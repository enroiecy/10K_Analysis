ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company) is engaged primarily in developing, 
manufacturing, and marketing consumer and commercial imaging products.  
Kodak's sales, earnings and identifiable assets by industry segment for the 
past three years are shown in Segment Information on page 43.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSUMER IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the consumer imaging segment, including intersegment sales, for the 
past three years were:

(in millions)                                      1995       1994       1993 

                                                 $6,830     $5,919     $5,292 

The products of the consumer imaging segment are used for capturing, 
recording or displaying a consumer originated image.  For example, 
traditional amateur photography requires, at a minimum, a camera, film, and 
photofinishing.  Photofinishing requires equipment and supplies, including 
chemicals and paper for prints.

Kodak manufactures and markets various components of imaging systems.  For 
amateur photography, Kodak supplies films, photographic papers, processing 
services, photographic chemicals, cameras and projectors.  Recent imaging 
products developed by Kodak include new generations of films, cameras, 
photographic papers and one-time-use cameras.  In early 1996, the Company 
announced its line-up of Advanced Photo System (APS) products encompassing 
new cameras, films and services.  APS is a new amateur film format which 
delivers a variety of new consumer features such as drop-in loading and 
multiple capture options.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's consumer imaging products and services 
are distributed worldwide through a variety of channels.  Individual products 
are often used in substantial quantities in more than one market.  Most sales 
of the consumer imaging segment are made through dealers.  Independent retail 
outlets selling Kodak amateur products total many thousands.  In a few areas 
abroad, Kodak products are marketed by independent national distributors.

Kodak's advertising programs actively promote its products and services in 
its various markets, and its principal trademarks, trade dress, and corporate 
symbol are widely used and recognized.

Kodak's consumer imaging products and services compete with similar products 
and services of others.  Competition in traditional imaging markets is strong 
throughout the world.  Many large and small companies offer similar products 
and services that compete with Kodak's business.  Kodak's products are 
continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its 
customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the consumer imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing.  Digital electronics 
are becoming more prevalent in product offerings.

COMMERCIAL IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the commercial imaging segment for the past three years were:

(in millions)                                     1995       1994       1993

                                                $8,184     $7,646     $7,382

The commercial imaging segment consists of businesses that serve the imaging 
and information needs of commercial customers.  Products in this segment are 
used to capture, store, process and display images and information in a 
variety of forms.

Kodak products for the commercial imaging segment include films, photographic 
papers, photographic plates, chemicals, processing equipment and audiovisual 
equipment, as well as copiers, graphic arts films, microfilm products, 
applications software, printers and other business equipment, supplies and 
service agreements to support these products.  These products serve 
professional photofinishers, professional photographers, customers in the 
health care industry, and customers in motion picture, television, commercial 
printing and publishing, office automation and government markets.  Recently 
introduced  commercial imaging products include digital and applied imaging 
products which capture, store and print images in an electronic format.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's commercial imaging products and services 
are distributed through a variety of channels.  The Company also sells and 
leases business equipment directly to users.  

Kodak's commercial imaging products and services compete with similar 
products and services of other small and large companies.  Strong competition 
exists throughout the world.  Kodak's products are continually improved to 
meet the changing needs and preferences of its customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the commercial imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing.  Electronic 
components represent a significant portion of the cost of the materials used 
in the manufacture of business equipment.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - HEALTH BUSINESSES

In 1994, the Company divested the following non-imaging health businesses for 
aggregate gross proceeds of $7,858 million:  the pharmaceutical and consumer 
health businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division.  These businesses are reported as discontinued operations with 
results for prior periods restated.  

Sales of products of these discontinued health businesses for the two years 
ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 were (1994 sales are through sales dates):

(in millions)                           1994       1993      

                                      $3,175     $3,694

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - CHEMICALS SEGMENT

On December 31, 1993, the Company distributed all of the outstanding shares 
of common stock of Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman), which represented 
substantially all of the Company's worldwide chemical business, as a dividend 
to the Company's shareowners (the spin-off) in a ratio of one share of 
Eastman common stock for every four shares of Kodak common stock.  As a 
result of the spin-off, Eastman became an independent publicly held company 
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and its operation ceased to be owned by 
the Company.  In connection with the spin-off, Eastman assumed $1.8 billion 
of new borrowings, the proceeds from which were used by the Company to retire 
other borrowings.  The chemicals segment has been reported as discontinued 
operations.  Sales of chemicals segment products, including intersegment 
sales, for the year ended December 31, 1993 were $3,976 million.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Through the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in 
research and development.  In 1995, $935 million (1994 - $859 million; 1993 - 
$864 million) was expended for research and development for continuing 
operations.  Research and development groups are located principally in the 
United States in Rochester, New York.  Outside the U.S., research and 
development groups are located in Australia, England, France, Japan and 
Germany.  These groups, in close cooperation with manufacturing units and 
marketing organizations, are constantly developing new products and 
applications to serve both existing and new markets.

It has been Kodak's general practice to protect its investment in research 
and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents 
where feasible.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's 
ability to use its inventions but at the same time is accompanied by 
significant patent licensing. While in the aggregate Kodak's patents are 
considered to be of material importance in the operation of its business, it 
does not consider that the patents relating to any single product or process 
are of material significance when judged from the standpoint of its total 
business.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning 
environmental matters.  Some of the U.S. federal environmental legislation 
having an impact on Kodak includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act, and the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the 
Superfund law).

Kodak continues to engage in a program for environmental protection and 
control.  During 1995, expenditures for pollution prevention and waste 
treatment at various manufacturing facilities totaled $106 million.  These 
costs included $72 million of recurring costs associated with managing 
hazardous substances and pollution in on-going operations, $31 million of 
capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances or pollutants, 
and $3 million of mandated expenditures to remediate previously contaminated 
sites.  These expenditures have been accounted for in accordance with the 
Company's accounting policy for environmental costs.  The Company expects 
these recurring and remediation costs to increase and capital to increase 
significantly in the near future.  While these costs will continue to require 
significant cash outflows for the Company, it is not expected that these 
costs will have an impact materially different from 1995's environmental 
expenditures on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash 
flows or competitive position.

In October 1994, the Company, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement of a civil complaint 
alleging noncompliance by the Company with federal environmental regulations 
at the Company's Kodak Park manufacturing site in Rochester, New York.  The 
Company paid a penalty of $5 million.  A Consent Decree was signed under 
which the Company is subject to a Compliance Schedule by which the Company 
will improve its waste characterization procedures, upgrade one of its 
incinerators and evaluate and upgrade its industrial sewer system over a 
12-year period.  The total expenditures that may be required to complete this 
program cannot currently be reasonably estimated since upgrade plans have not 
been finalized and must be developed on an ongoing basis.  Further, most of 
the expenditures associated with the program will be capital in nature.

The RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining to the Company's Kodak Park 
site in Rochester, New York is nearly complete and the Company has completed 
a broad-based assessment of the site in response to the RFA.  While future 
expenditures associated with any remediation activities could be significant, 
the Company is currently in the process of completing the RCRA facility 
investigation (RFI).  Upon completion of the RFI, the Company expects to have 
developed estimates of the required remediation costs.

The Company accrues for remediation costs which relate to an existing 
condition caused by past operations when it is probable that these costs will 
be incurred and can be reasonably estimated.  The Company had reserves for 
remediation costs of $114 million and $108 million at December 31, 1995 and 
1994, respectively.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  The Company may be 
required to incur significant costs, primarily capital in nature, over a 
period of several years to comply with the provisions of this Act.  The 
expenditures that may be required cannot be reasonably estimated at the 
present time since either implementing regulations have not been issued or 
compliance plans have not been finalized.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMPLOYMENT

At the end of 1995, the Company employed 96,600 people, of whom 54,400 were 
employed in the U.S.  
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial information by geographic areas for the past three years is shown 
in Segment Information on page 42.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The consumer imaging segment of Kodak's business in the United States is 
centered in and near Rochester, New York, where photographic goods are 
manufactured.  Another manufacturing facility near Windsor, Colorado, also 
produces sensitized photographic goods.  Regional distribution centers are 
located in various places within the United States.

Consumer imaging manufacturing facilities outside the United States are 
located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  
Kodak maintains marketing and distribution facilities in many parts of the 
world.  The Company also owns processing laboratories in numerous locations 
worldwide.

Products in the commercial imaging segment are manufactured primarily in 
Rochester, New York and Windsor, Colorado.  Manufacturing facilities outside 
the United States are located in Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

The Company owns or leases administrative, manufacturing, marketing, and 
processing facilities in various parts of the world.  The leases are for 
various periods and are generally renewable.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In April 1987, the Company was sued in federal district court in San 
Francisco by a number of independent service organizations who alleged 
violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and of various state 
statutes in the sale by the Company of repair parts for its copier and 
micrographics equipment (Image Technical Service, Inc. (ITS), et al v. 
Eastman Kodak Company).  The complaint sought unspecified compensatory and 
punitive damages.  Trial began on June 19, 1995 and concluded on September 
18, 1995 with a jury verdict for plaintiffs of $23,948,300, before trebling.  
The Company intends to appeal the jury's verdict and otherwise to continue to 
defend this action vigorously.

Two cases that raise essentially the same antitrust issues as ITS are pending 
in federal district court in San Francisco (Nationwide, et al v. Eastman 
Kodak Company, filed March 10, 1995, and A-1 Copy Center, et al v. Eastman 
Kodak Company, filed December 13, 1993, the latter a consolidated class 
action).  The complaints in Nationwide and A-1 seek unspecified compensatory 
and punitive damages.  Stays in both these cases have been lifted effective 
March 1, 1996, so the Company expects that activity will now accelerate, with 
the possibility of trials within the next two years.  As is the case in ITS, 
the Company is defending both of these matters vigorously.

The Company is participating in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8 (e) Compliance Audit Program.  
As a participant, the Company has agreed to audit its files for materials 
which under current EPA guidelines would be subject to notification under 
Section 8 (e) of TSCA and to pay stipulated penalties for each report 
submitted under this program.  The Company anticipates that its liability 
under the Program will be $1,000,000.

In addition to the foregoing environmental action, the Company has been 
designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended 
(the Superfund law), or under similar state laws, for environmental 
assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the Company's alleged 
arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at approximately 
twenty-five Superfund sites.  With respect to each of these sites, the 
Company's actual or potential allocated share of responsibility is small.  
Furthermore, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated at these 
sites and, although the law imposes joint and several liability on PRPs, as a 
practical matter, costs are shared with other PRPs.  Settlements and costs 
paid by the Company in Superfund matters to date have not been material.  
Future costs are also not expected to be material to the Company's financial 
condition or results of operations.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits, claims, 
investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, commercial, 
environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being handled and 
defended in the ordinary course of business.  There are no such matters 
pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to be material in 
relation to the Company's business, financial condition, or results of 
operations.

(1)  After deducting $340 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations which

(2)  After deducting $495 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations which 
     reduced net earnings by $353 million and $55 million of restructuring costs from 
     discontinued operations which reduced net earnings by $34 million.  The net loss for 1993 
     was due to an after-tax charge of $2.17 billion from the cumulative effect of adopting 
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
     Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting

(3)  After deducting $219 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations which 
     reduced net earnings by $140 million and $1 million of restructuring costs from 
     discontinued operations which reduced net earnings by less than $1 million.  Net earnings 
     for 1992 benefited by $152 million from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109, 
     "Accounting for Income Taxes."
(4)  After deducting $1,448 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations which 
     reduced net earnings by $934 million and $157 million of restructuring costs from 
     discontinued operations which reduced net earnings by $98 million.
(5)  The lower dividends in 1995 and 1994 were due to the spin-off of the Eastman Chemical 
     Company operations at year-end 1993.  As a result of the spin-off, the Company's 
     shareowners received one share of Eastman Chemical Company stock for every four shares of 
     Kodak common stock.

1995

Sales for 1995 were $14,980 million.  Net earnings of $1,252 million ($3.67 
per share) included charges of $54 million for write-offs of intangible 
assets principally associated with the Health Imaging business.  

On January 18, 1996, the Company announced it is developing alternatives to 
strengthen and reposition its Office Imaging business.  The Office Imaging 
business is involved primarily with the development, production, sale and 
service of office reprographics, document processing and reproduction 
equipment.  The Company is exploring a variety of strategic options and 
structural alternatives, which include expanding its use of strategic 
alliances, the formation of joint ventures, and potential divestiture.

In connection with the divestiture of the non-imaging health businesses 
discussed below,  the Company sold its research and development facility to 
SmithKline Beecham for $120 million in early 1995.  The proceeds from this 
sale did not differ materially from the recorded value for this facility. 

1994

In 1994, the Company divested the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division for aggregate proceeds of $7.9 billion.  These businesses were 
reported as discontinued operations for 1994 with prior periods restated.   
The Company used proceeds from the divestiture, short-term borrowings and 
cash from operations to extinguish $6,598 million (net carrying amount) of 
borrowings, $7,800 million (notional amount) of financial instruments, a 
$292 million master lease program and a $200 million receivable financing 
program.  

Sales from continuing operations in 1994 were $13,557 million.  Earnings from 
continuing operations were $554 million ($1.65 per share) for 1994.  Earnings 
from continuing operations in 1994 included $340 million of pre-tax 
restructuring costs ($254 million or $.75 per share after-tax), incremental 
charges associated with the review of the carrying value of assets of $65 
million and a $110 million pre-tax loss associated with the extinguishment of 
certain financial instruments.  An extraordinary loss of $266 million 
after-tax ($.79 per share) was also recognized in connection with the 
reduction of debt and other financial instruments.  Earnings from 
discontinued operations were $269 million ($.80 per share) which was comprised 
of a net after-tax gain of $350 million realized from the sale of the 
non-imaging health businesses less an after-tax loss from operations prior to 
measurement date of $81 million.  Net earnings were $557 million ($1.66 per 
share).

1993

On December 31, 1993, the Company distributed to its shareowners all of the 
outstanding shares of common stock of its worldwide chemicals business (the 
spin-off), which consisted of Eastman Chemical Company operations.  Results 
for Eastman Chemical Company operations are reported as discontinued 
operations for 1993 and include allocations of interest and taxes to the 
Chemicals segment and transaction costs associated with the spin-off.

Sales from continuing operations in 1993 were $12,670 million.  Earnings from 
continuing operations of $644 million ($1.95 per share) were impacted by 
restructuring costs from continuing operations of $495 million ($353 million 
after-tax or $1.08 per share).  Earnings from discontinued operations were 
$23 million ($.07 per share) which represented net earnings from the 
discontinued Chemicals business of $192 million offset by a net loss of 
$169 million for the discontinued non-imaging health businesses.  Net 
earnings for 1993 were also impacted by an extraordinary charge of $14 million 
after-tax ($.04 per share) related to the early extinguishment of debt.  The 
net loss of $1.51 billion ($4.62 per share) recorded in 1993 was due to an 
after-tax charge of $2.17 billion ($6.60 per share) associated with the 
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, 
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" and 
SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" effective 
as of January 1, 1993.

1995 COMPARED WITH 1994

Worldwide 1995 sales from continuing operations increased 10% compared with 
1994, primarily due to higher unit volumes.  Excluding sales of the Company's 
Qualex subsidiary, acquired in August 1994, sales increased 8%, primarily due 
to higher unit volumes and the effects of foreign exchange.  Currency changes 
against the dollar favorably affected sales by $453 million in 1995 and $135 
million in 1994.  Sales for the Consumer Imaging segment increased 
significantly, while the Commercial Imaging segment showed a moderate sales 
increase.  Consumer Imaging sales to customers in the U.S. increased 
substantially over 1994 due to higher volumes and the inclusion of Qualex 
revenues, whose sales are included in the consolidated totals from August 
1994.  Prior to August 1994, Qualex's results were recorded using the equity 
method of accounting.  Sales to customers in the U.S., excluding Qualex 
sales, increased slightly.  Sales to customers outside the U.S. increased 
significantly from 1994, as good volume gains and the favorable effects of 
foreign currency rate changes were only partially offset by lower effective 
selling prices.  Worldwide volume increases were led by Ektacolor papers, 
Kodacolor 35mm films and one-time-use cameras.  Commercial Imaging sales to 
customers in the U.S. increased 3%, as volume increases were slightly offset 
by lower effective selling prices.  Commercial Imaging sales to customers 
outside the U.S. increased significantly from 1994, as good volume gains and 
the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes were slightly offset 
by lower effective selling prices.  Motion Picture and Television Imaging and 
Digital and Applied Imaging led the worldwide sales increases.

Operating earnings from continuing operations increased 48% from 1994.  
Excluding 1994 restructuring costs of $340 million, operating earnings from 
continuing operations increased 18%.  Consumer Imaging operating earnings 
increased 46% (20% excluding 1994 restructuring costs).  Consumer Imaging 
operating earnings benefited from increased unit volumes, productivity gains 
and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes, but were 
adversely affected by cost escalation, higher levels of marketing and 
administrative activity and lower effective selling prices.

Commercial Imaging operating earnings increased 53% (13% excluding 1994 
restructuring costs).  Commercial Imaging operating earnings benefited from 
increased unit volumes, productivity gains and the favorable effects of 
foreign currency rate changes, but were adversely affected by cost 
escalation, lower effective selling prices, and $54 million of intangible 
asset write-offs principally associated with the Health Imaging business.

Research and development expenditures were $935 million in 1995 and $859 
million in 1994.  Goodwill charges were $109 million in 1995 and $67 million 
in 1994.  The increase was attributed to intangible asset write-offs, 
principally associated with the Health Imaging business, and the inclusion of 
a full year of Qualex goodwill amortization.  Advertising and sales promotion 
expenses totaled $840 million in 1995 and $744 million in 1994.  Other 
marketing and administrative expenses totaled $3,318 million in 1995 and 
$2,967 million in 1994.  Increases in selling, general and administrative 
expenses in 1995 resulted from the unfavorable effects of foreign currency 
rate changes, higher activity levels and the inclusion of a full year of 
Qualex activity.

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues were $289 million in 1995 
compared with $130 million in 1994.  The increase in 1995 was primarily due 
to higher interest income and gains from the sales of capital assets.  
Interest expense of $78 million in 1995 decreased from $142 million in 1994 
due to lower debt levels.  Other costs of $210 million in 1995 are 
essentially level with 1994 after excluding $110 million of 1994 charges 
associated with the extinguishment of certain financial instruments.

The effective tax rates were 35% in 1995 and 39% in 1994, excluding 
restructuring costs.  The lower effective tax rate principally results from 
the utilization of certain foreign tax loss carryforwards.

1994 COMPARED WITH 1993   

Worldwide sales from continuing operations in 1994 were up 7% when compared 
with 1993 primarily due to higher unit volumes.  Sales for the Consumer 
Imaging segment increased significantly, while Commercial Imaging segment 
sales were up slightly.  In the Consumer Imaging segment, 1994 sales to 
customers inside the U.S. were up significantly over 1993 due to volume gains 
and the inclusion of revenues from Qualex, which became a consolidated 
subsidiary in August 1994 and whose sales are included in the consolidated 
totals from August 1994.  Excluding sales of Qualex, sales to customers in 
the U.S. posted a moderate increase.  Sales to customers outside the U.S. in 
1994 recorded good increases over 1993 as significant volume gains and the 
favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes were partially offset by 
lower effective selling prices.  Worldwide volume increases were led by 
Ektacolor papers, Kodacolor 35mm films and one-time-use cameras.  In the 
Commercial Imaging segment, 1994 sales to customers in the U.S. were up 1% 
over 1993 as volume increases were partially offset by lower effective 
selling prices.  Sales to customers outside the U.S. in 1994 increased 
moderately over the previous year as moderate volume gains and the favorable 
effects of foreign currency rate changes were partially offset by lower 
effective selling prices. Worldwide sales increases were led by Printing and 
Professional Imaging, Motion Picture and Television Imaging, and Health 
Imaging products.

Operating earnings from continuing operations were adversely affected by 
restructuring costs of $340 million in 1994 and $495 million in 1993.  The 1994 
restructuring costs represented severance and other termination benefits for 
approximately 4,350 personnel and exit costs related to the realignment of 
Kodak's worldwide manufacturing, marketing, administrative and photofinishing 
operations.  The 1993 restructuring costs represented the cost of separation 
benefits for a worldwide program expected to reduce employment by 
approximately 9,000 personnel and the cost of closing a facility in Germany 
associated with the Company's ink jet printing business.  Consumer Imaging 
operating earnings were adversely affected by restructuring costs of 
$190 million in 1994 compared with $141 million in 1993.  Before deducting 
restructuring costs in both years, operating earnings in 1994 were 
essentially level with 1993.  Consumer Imaging operating earnings for 1994 
benefited from higher volumes and manufacturing productivity, but were 
adversely affected by higher levels of marketing and administrative activity, 
cost escalation and lower effective selling prices.  Consumer Imaging 
operating earnings in 1994 were reduced by premium costs associated with 
strategic currency hedges, while 1993 operating earnings benefited from gains 
on strategic currency hedges.  Commercial Imaging operating earnings were 
adversely affected by restructuring costs of $150 million in 1994 and 
$354 million in 1993.  Operating earnings for Commercial Imaging were lower 
in 1994 compared to 1993 before the deduction of restructuring costs in both 
years.  Benefits from manufacturing productivity, higher volumes and lower 
research and development activity were more than offset by cost escalation 
and lower effective selling prices.  Commercial Imaging operating earnings in 
1994 were reduced by premium costs associated with strategic currency hedges, 
while 1993 operating earnings benefited from gains on strategic currency 
hedges.

Research and development expenditures for continuing operations were 
$859 million in 1994 and $864 million in 1993.  Amortization of goodwill for 
continuing operations in 1994 was $67 million, while $29 million was recorded 
in 1993.  This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Qualex.  
Advertising and sales promotion expenses for continuing operations totaled 
$744 million in 1994 and $646 million in 1993.  Other marketing and 
administrative expenses for continuing operations totaled $2,967 million in 
1994 and $2,774 million in 1993.  Increases in advertising and sales promotion 
and other marketing and administrative expenses in 1994 resulted from cost 
escalation, higher activity levels, the unfavorable effects of foreign 
currency rate changes and the acquisition of Qualex.

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues were $130 million in 1994 
compared with $203 million in 1993.  The amount reported in 1993 was higher 
than 1994 due to larger gains from the sale of investments and other items in 
1993.  Interest expense of $142 million in 1994 was lower than the $175 million 
incurred in 1993 primarily due to lower levels of borrowings. Interest 
expense of approximately $390 million in 1994 and $586 million in 1993, and 
capitalized interest of approximately $7 million in 1994 and $51 million in 
1993 were allocated to discontinued operations.  The increase in other costs 
in 1994 when compared with 1993 is primarily due to the inclusion in 1994 of 
$110 million of charges associated with the extinguishment of certain 
financial instruments.

In 1994 and 1993, the Company used foreign currency option contracts to hedge 
its exposure  to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for anticipated 
sales and purchases for certain foreign affiliates and possible anticipated 
export sales.  Currency changes against the U.S. dollar favorably affected 
1994 sales from continuing operations by $135 million and unfavorably affected 
1993 sales from continuing operations by $490 million.  These effects were 
partially offset by premium costs of $86 million and gains of $73 million from 
strategic currency hedges in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company also 
entered into foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of its 
transactions in foreign currency
denominated receivables and payables.  The effect of these hedges and the net 
gains and losses on transaction exposures was a loss of $46 million in 1994 
and a loss of $44 million in 1993.

The effective tax rates for continuing operations, excluding restructuring 
costs, were 39% in 1994 and 37% in 1993.  The rates reflect the impact of 
operating losses in jurisdictions outside the U.S. for which tax benefits 
cannot be claimed.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company commenced a program to 
repurchase $1 billion of its outstanding common stock and completed the 
contribution of $500 million in stock to its U.S. pension plan.  The stock 
repurchase is being made from available cash reserves and cash from 
operations.  At year end, $300 million has been repurchased, with the 
$700 million remaining to be repurchased on an ongoing basis.

Cash flow from operations in 1995 was $2,630 million, primarily due to net 
earnings of $1,252 million which included non-cash expenses for depreciation 
and amortization of $916 million.  Net cash outflow from investing activities 
was $2,380 million in 1995, due to capital expenditures of $1,034 million and 
$1,411 million of cash payments, principally for taxes related to the sales 
of the non-imaging health businesses.  Net cash outflow from financing 
activities in 1995 of $512 million was primarily due to $547 million of 
dividend payments.

Total cash dividends (paid on a quarterly basis) of approximately $547 million 
($1.60 per share), $537 million ($1.60 per share) and $657 million ($2.00 per 
share) were declared in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The lower 1995 
and 1994 dividends reflect the spin-off of Eastman Chemical Company 
operations at year-end 1993.  As a result of the spin-off, the Company's 
shareowners received one share of Eastman Chemical Company stock for every 
four shares of Kodak common stock.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year-end 1995 were 
$1,811 million, a $257 million decrease from the year-end 1994 total of 
$2,068 million.  Included in cash and cash equivalents at year-end 1994 was a 
$1,550 million note received on December 31, 1994 when the Company completed 
the sale of its household products business of L&F Products.  This note was
paid in cash to the Company on January 3, 1995.  Net working capital at
year-end 1995 increased to $2,666 million from $1,948 million at year-end
1994.  The net change was caused primarily by increases in accounts
receivable and inventory as a result of increased sales volume.

Total short-term and long-term borrowings totaled $1,251 million at year-end 
1995 and $1,031 million at year-end 1994.  During 1994, the Company used a 
portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the non-imaging health 
businesses to extinguish $6,598 million (net carrying amount) of borrowings.  
The Company has access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in 
May 1999.  The Company also has a shelf registration statement for debt 
securities with an available balance of $2.2 billion.

Capital additions for the Consumer Imaging segment were $240 million and $303 
million in 1995 and 1994, respectively, and $794 million and $850 million for 
the Commercial Imaging segment.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the 
consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear on pages 18 
through 44.  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles and include certain amounts that are 
based on management's best estimates and judgments.
  The Company's accounting systems include extensive internal controls 
designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial 
records and the proper safeguarding and use of its assets.  Such controls are 
based on established policies and procedures, are implemented by trained, 
skilled personnel with an appropriate segregation of duties, and are 
monitored through a comprehensive internal audit program.  The Company's 
policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all employees are to 
maintain the highest ethical standards and that its business practices 
throughout the world are to be conducted in a manner which is above reproach.
  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Price Waterhouse 
LLP, independent accountants, who were responsible for conducting their 
audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Their 
resulting report is shown below.
  The Board of Directors exercises its responsibility for these financial 
statements through its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of 
non-management Board members.  The independent accountants and internal 
auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee.  The Audit 
Committee meets periodically with the independent accountants and the 
Director of Corporate Auditing, both privately and with management present, 
to discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of
Eastman Kodak Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in 
the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 46 of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Eastman Kodak Company and subsidiary companies at December 31, 
1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements 
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We 
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed 
above.

As discussed in Note 14, the Company changed its method of accounting for 
certain postretirement benefits and other postemployment benefits in 1993.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

COMPANY OPERATIONS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company) is engaged primarily in developing, 
manufacturing, and marketing consumer and commercial imaging products.  The 
Company's products are manufactured in a number of countries in North and 
South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.  The Company's products are 
marketed and sold in many countries throughout the world.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman Kodak 
Company and its majority owned subsidiary companies.  Intercompany 
transactions are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of 
the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to minority interests.  

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Certain significant 
estimates are disclosed throughout this report.

FOREIGN CURRENCY 

For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is 
the functional currency and translation adjustments are accumulated in a 
separate component of shareowners' equity.

For subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic 
environment is highly inflationary, the U.S. dollar is the functional 
currency and gains and losses that result from translation are included in 
earnings.  The effect from foreign currency translation was a gain of $14 
million in 1995, a loss of $7 million in 1994 and a loss of $10 million in 
1993.  The effect from foreign currency transactions was a loss of $76 
million in 1995, a loss of $46 million in 1994 and a loss of $44 million in 
1993.  

CASH EQUIVALENTS

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or 
less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.  At December 
31, 1994, included in "cash and cash equivalents" is a $1,550 million note 
received in connection with the sale of the household products business which 
had a maturity of four days.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of market.  The cost 
of most inventories in the U.S. is determined by the "last-in, first-out" 
(LIFO) method.  The cost of other inventories is determined by the "first-in, 
first-out" (FIFO) or average cost method.

PROPERTIES

Properties are recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation.  
Depreciation expense is provided based on historical cost and estimated 
useful lives ranging from approximately 5 years to 50 years for buildings and 
building equipment and 5 years to 20 years for machinery and equipment.  The 
Company generally uses the straight-line method for calculating the provision 
for depreciation. 

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND NONCURRENT INVESTMENTS

Investments included in marketable securities of $42 million and $21 million 
and in long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets of $60 million and 
$103 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, are considered held 
to maturity.  Investments included in marketable securities of $5 million and 
$27 million and in long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets of $35 
million and $44 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, are 
considered available for sale.  The fair value of all securities approximates 
cost.  The maturities of long-term receivables range from 1997 to 2004.

Proceeds from the sale of securities were $48 million in 1995 and $249 million 
in 1994.  No gain or loss was realized from the sale of these securities in 
1995 while a loss of $8 million was realized in 1994.  Specific 
identification was used to determine the cost of securities sold.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period 
estimated to be benefited, not exceeding fifteen years for continuing 
operations.  The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill on an ongoing 
basis.  While management believes that the current carrying value of goodwill 
is appropriate, that carrying value is based upon profitability and cash flow 
forecasts of the related entities.
  
REVENUE

Revenue is recognized from the sale of film, paper, supplies and equipment 
(including sales-type leases for equipment) when the product is shipped; from 
maintenance and service contracts over the contractual period, or as the 
services are performed; from rentals under operating leases in the month in 
which they are earned; and from financing transactions at level rates of 
return over the term of the lease or receivable.

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in "selling, general 
and administrative expenses."  Advertising expenses amounted to $840 million, 
$744 million and $646 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or 
capitalized, as appropriate.  Remediation costs that relate to an existing 
condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that 
these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes.  
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the 
amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes 
and such amounts recognized for tax purposes.  

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Primary earnings per share, where such calculation is not anti-dilutive, is 
computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares 
outstanding.  

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for 
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed 
Of," must be adopted in 1996.  The standard requires that impairment losses 
be recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value.  
The Company regularly assesses all of its long-lived assets for impairment 
and, therefore, does not believe the adoption of the standard will have a 
material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 

SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," must be adopted in 
1996.  This standard encourages, but does not require, recognition of 
compensation expense based on the fair value of equity instruments granted to 
employees.  The Company does not plan to record compensation for equity 
instruments granted to employees and therefore the adoption of this standard 
will have no impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications of 1994 and 1993 financial statement and related 
footnote amounts have been made to conform with the 1995 presentation.

NOTE 2

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 1994, the Company sold the pharmaceutical and consumer health businesses 
of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and do-it-yourself products 
businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics Division.  The Company 
received $7,858 million in proceeds from the sale of these businesses.  For 
1994 and prior periods, the results of these businesses were reported as 
discontinued operations.  Summarized results of the discontinued non-imaging 
health businesses, including allocations of interest expense were: 1994 - 
sales of $3,175 million, a loss from the measurement date to the disposal 
date of $77 million ($86 million pre-tax), a gain on the sale of businesses 
of $1,933 million before income taxes of $1,506 million and an after-tax loss 
prior to measurement date of $81 million ($84 million pre-tax); 1993 - sales 
of $3,694 million, a loss from operations of $221 million before benefit for 
income taxes of $52 million.  

In computing the net gain from discontinued operations, the Company recorded 
amounts for environmental exposures, product liabilities, buyer 
indemnifications, purchase price adjustments, taxes and other significant 
items based on the best estimates available at the time the transactions 
occurred.  While the balances included in these reserves are believed to be 
appropriate based on management's current judgments, changes could occur as 
final negotiations of these sales and audits related to these transactions 
are completed.

In December 1993, the Company spun off its Eastman Chemical Company 
operations.  Summarized results of the chemicals segment for 1993, including 
allocations of interest expense were: sales of $3,695 million, earnings from 
operations of $267 million before income taxes of $75 million.

The Company sells to customers in a variety of industries, markets and 
geographies around the world.  Receivables arising from these sales are 
generally not collateralized.  Adequate provisions have been recorded for 
uncollectible receivables.  There are no significant concentrations of credit 
risk.

Annual maturities (in millions) of long-term borrowings outstanding at 
December 31, 1995 are as follows:  1996: $2; 1997: $250; 1998: $11; 1999: 
$79; 2000: $1; and 2001  and beyond: $322.

In 1994, the Company tendered, defeased and called a total of $6,043 million 
(net carrying amount) of long-term borrowings and extinguished approximately 
$7,800 million (notional amount) of derivatives.  An extraordinary loss of 
$266 million after-tax ($367 million pre-tax) was recorded on the early 
extinguishment of debt.  In addition to the extraordinary loss, a $110 
million pre-tax loss was recorded in "other costs" for certain financial 
instruments related to other programs.

The in-substance defeasance was achieved by purchasing investment instruments 
under an arrangement consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 76, 
"Extinguishment of Debt."  The Company believes that the investments placed 
in the defeasance trust will be sufficient to satisfy all future debt service 
requirements for the defeased debt instruments.  The total cash paid for the 
investments placed in the defeasance trust, including transaction costs, 
amounted to $1,692 million.

The Company has a $2,500 million unused revolving credit facility established 
in 1994 and expiring in May 1999 which is available to support the Company's 
commercial paper borrowings.  The credit facility is subject to a number of 
covenants including certain financial covenants related to interest expense 
coverage.  The Company believes that it is in full compliance with all 
covenants pertaining to the credit facility.  If unused, it has a commitment 
fee of $2.5 million per year.  Interest on amounts borrowed under this 
facility is calculated at rates based on spreads above certain reference 
rates.  The Company also has a shelf registration statement for debt 
securities with an available balance of $2.2 billion.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment for continuing 
operations at various manufacturing facilities totaled $106 million, 
$122 million and $134 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  These 
expenditures included the following elements:

Recurring costs for managing

                                    ====     ====     ====  

At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company's accrued liabilities for 
environmental remediation costs amounted to $114 million and $108 million, 
respectively.

In October 1994, the Company, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement of a civil complaint 
alleging noncompliance by the Company with federal environmental regulations 
at the Company's Kodak Park manufacturing site in Rochester, New York.  The 
Company paid a penalty of $5 million.  A Consent Decree was signed under 
which the Company is subject to a Compliance Schedule by which the Company 
will improve its waste characterization procedures, upgrade one of its 
incinerators, and evaluate and upgrade its industrial sewer system over a 
12-year period.  The expenditures that may be required to complete this 
program cannot currently be reasonably estimated since upgrade plans must be 
developed on an ongoing basis.  Further, most costs associated with the 
program will be for capital expenditures.

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
Act of 1980, as amended (the Superfund law), or under similar state laws, for 
environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the Company's 
alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at approximately 
twenty-five Superfund sites.  With respect to each of these sites, the 
Company's actual or potential allocated share of responsibility is small.  
Furthermore, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated at these 
sites and, although the law imposes joint and several liability on PRPs, as a 
practical matter, costs are shared with other PRPs.  Settlements and costs 
paid by the Company in Superfund matters to date have not been material.  
Future costs are also not expected to be material to the Company's financial 
condition or results of operations.

In addition to the foregoing environmental actions, the Resource Conservation 
and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining to the Kodak 
Park site in Rochester, N.Y. is nearly complete and the Company has completed 
a broad-based assessment of the site in response to the RFA.  While future 
expenditures associated with any remediation activities could be significant, 
the Company is currently in the process of completing the RCRA facility 
investigation (RFI).  Upon completion of the RFI, the Company expects to have 
developed estimates of the required remediation costs.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  The Company may be 
required to incur significant costs, primarily capital in nature, over a 
period of several years to comply with the provisions of this Act.  The 
expenditures that may be required cannot currently be reasonably estimated 
since either implementing regulations have not been issued or compliance 
plans have not been finalized.

The Company has retained certain obligations for environmental remediation 
matters related to the non-imaging health businesses sold in 1994.  Actions 
to fulfill these obligations are not expected to be completed in the near 
term and costs related to the obligations are included in remediation 
accruals recorded at December 31, 1995.

The Company has entered into agreements with several companies to provide the 
Company with products and services to be used in its normal operations.  The 
minimum payments for these agreements are approximately $102 million in 1996, 
$96 million in 1997, $93 million in 1998, $91 million in 1999, $28 million in 
2000 and $50 million in 2001 and thereafter.

The Company has also guaranteed debt and other obligations under agreements 
with certain affiliated companies and customers.  At December 31, 1995, these 
guarantees totaled approximately $232 million.  The Company does not expect 
that these guarantees will have a material impact on the Company's future 
financial position or results of operations.

The Company has issued letters of credit in lieu of making security deposits 
to insure the payment of possible Workers' Compensation claims.

Gross rentals amounted to $189 million in both 1995 and 1994, and $174 
million in 1993.  The approximate amounts of noncancelable lease commitments 
with terms of more than one year, principally for the rental of real 
property, are $97 million in 1996, $74 million in 1997, $51 million in 1998, 
$40 million in 1999, $32 million in 2000 and $51 million in 2001 and 
thereafter.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits, claims, 
investigations and proceedings, including product liability, commercial, 
environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being handled and 
defended in the ordinary course of business.  There are no such matters 
pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to be material in 
relation to the Company's business, financial condition or results of 
operations.

securities and other investments are valued at quoted market prices, except 
for $74 million and $66 million of equity investments included in other 
investments at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively, which are reflected 
at their carrying value because it is not practical to estimate fair value as 
quoted market prices do not exist.  The fair values for the remaining 
financial instruments in the above table are based on dealer quotes and 
reflect the estimated amounts the Company would pay or receive to terminate 
the contracts.  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, 
short-term borrowings, and payables approximate their fair values.

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financial activities, is 
exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  
In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such 
activities, the Company manages exposure to changes in interest rates and 
foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing 
activities.  During 1995, the Company elected to no longer manage these 
exposures through the use of financial instruments.  

In connection with a long-term intercompany loan to a Japanese affiliate, the 
Company has entered into a currency swap contract to purchase Japanese yen 
with a contract value of $135 million to be settled in April 1997.

The table below summarizes by major currency the notional amounts of foreign 
currency forward and option contracts in U.S. dollars.  At December 31, 1995, 
the Company was not a party to any such forward or option contracts.  Foreign 
currency amounts are translated at rates current at the reporting date.  The 
"buy" amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase 
foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S. dollar 
equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies.

The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to certain net operating 
loss carryforwards outside the U.S.  A majority of the net operating loss 
carryforwards are available indefinitely.

Retained earnings of subsidiary companies outside the U.S. were approximately 
$1,924 million and $1,810 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  
Retained earnings at December 31, 1995 are considered to be reinvested 
indefinitely.  If remitted, they would be substantially free of additional 
tax.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for 
temporary differences related to these retained earnings.

NOTE 12

RESTRUCTURING COSTS

1994 Restructuring Program

In December 1994, the Company committed to implement a restructuring program 
and recorded a pre-tax provision of $340 million for severance and other 
termination benefits and exit costs related to the realignment of the 
Company's worldwide manufacturing, marketing, administrative and 
photofinishing operations.

Severance actions included in the restructuring provision resulted from 
capacity reductions in manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of 
photofinishing operations and marketing and administrative functions in 
various locations of the Company's worldwide operations.  Most of the 
terminations were completed by the end of 1995; the remaining terminations 
are expected to be completed by June 30, 1996.

The following table summarizes the Company's restructuring activities 
relating to the 1994 program:

</TABLE>
1993 Restructuring Program

The Company recorded restructuring costs in 1993 for continuing operations of 
$495 million.  Approximately $350 million was provided for severance and 
termination benefit costs related to a cost reduction program to reduce 
worldwide employment by approximately 9,000 personnel.  At December 31, 1995, 
substantially all of the personnel had been terminated with approximately 
$11 million and $120 million being paid in 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The 
remaining 1993 restructuring provision related primarily to severance and 
exit costs associated with the closure of a German manufacturing facility.  
The costs charged to the remaining reserve in 1995 and 1994 amounted to 
$11 million and $47 million, respectively.  The remaining accrual balance at 
December 31, 1995, in the amount of $134 million will primarily provide for 
severance and termination payments to former employees.

Kodak Retirement Income Plan (KRIP), which is funded by Company contributions 
to an irrevocable trust fund.  Assets in the fund are held for the sole 
benefit of retired employees.  The Company made a $500 million contribution 
of its common stock to the trust fund in 1995.  Retirement benefits earned by 
employees prior to January 1, 1996, are based on a point system.  Retirement 
benefits earned by employees subsequent to December 31, 1995, will be based 
on age and years of service.   The benefit formula used to calculate the 
actual benefit dollars paid to an individual once retired will not change as 
a result of these new plan provisions.  Retirement benefits generally become 
vested upon the completion of five years of service.  The assets of the trust 
fund are comprised of corporate equity and debt securities, U.S. government 
securities, partnership and joint venture investments, interests in pooled 
funds, and various types of interest rate and foreign currency financial 
instruments.

The benefit obligations for KRIP include amounts for employees who retired 
from Eastman Chemical Company (ECC) on or before December 31, 1993, the date 
ECC was spun off from the Company.  Benefit obligations of all other ECC 
employees were transferred to ECC as part of the spin-off agreement.  The 
benefit obligation of KRIP excludes amounts for all employees (both retired 
and active) of the non-imaging health businesses sold in 1994 because those 
obligations were transferred to the buyers of the non-imaging health 
businesses.  The market value of assets of KRIP reflect the Company's 
estimates of the assets held for employees in continuing operations only.  
The transfer of assets from the KRIP trust fund to ECC and the buyers of the 
non-imaging health businesses was not completed as of December 31, 1995.  The 
Company anticipates the transfer of assets will not be completed for several 
years to ensure compliance with agreements and applicable government 
regulations.

Most other subsidiaries and branches operating outside the U.S. have 
retirement plans covering substantially all employees.  Contributions by the 
Company for these plans are typically deposited under government or other 
fiduciary-type arrangements.  Retirement benefits are generally based on 
contractual agreements that provide for benefit formulas using years of 
service and/or compensation prior to retirement.  The actuarial assumptions 
used for these plans reflect the diverse economic environments within the 
various countries in which the Company operates.  The following information 
includes data for significant plans outside the U.S.

The annual cost of postretirement employee benefits is based on assumed 
discount rates.  These rates are set relative to the general level of 
interest rates in the economy.  As a result, significant year-to-year changes 
in interest rates can cause material year-to-year changes in assumed discount 
rates and employee benefit liabilities and costs based on those rates.

The weighted assumptions used to compute pension amounts for Major Plans were 
as follows:

The Company also sponsors an unfunded plan for certain U.S. employees 
(primarily executives).  The benefits of this plan are obtained by applying 
KRIP provisions to all compensation, including compensation currently being 
deferred, and without regard to the legislated qualified plan maximums, 
reduced by benefits under KRIP.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the projected 
benefit obligations of this plan amounted to $159 million and $140 million, 
respectively.  The Company had recorded long-term liabilities at those dates 
of $143 million and $124 million, respectively.  Pension expense recorded in 
1995, 1994 and 1993 related to this plan was $17 million, $17 million and $15 
million, respectively.

NOTE 14

NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

The Company provides health care, dental and life insurance benefits to 
eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees.  In general, these 
benefits are provided to U.S. retirees that are covered by the provisions of 
the Company's principal pension plan.  Nonpension postretirement expense for 
1995, 1994 and 1993 was $148 million, $183 million and $255 million, 
respectively. A few of the Company's subsidiaries and branches operating 
outside the U.S. offer health care benefits; however, the cost of such 
benefits is insignificant to the Company.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 106 on January 1, 1993.  The obligation for 
continuing operations owed to current and retired employees, as of January 1, 
1993, was recognized on that date as a cumulative effect of a change in 
accounting principle of $1,557 million after-tax.  The Company plans to 
continue to fund these benefit costs on a "pay-as-you-go" basis and, 
consequently, the adoption of SFAS No. 106 will not significantly affect the 
Company's cash flows.

The net postretirement benefit cost includes the following components:

To estimate this obligation, health care costs were assumed to increase 9% in 
1996 with the rate of increase declining ratably to 5% by 2002 and 
thereafter.  The discount rates utilized to measure the obligation at 
December 31, 1995 and 1994, were 7.25% and 8.5%, respectively.  The annual 
costs of employee benefits related to postemployment and postretirement are 
based on assumed discount rates set relative to the general level of interest 
rates in the economy.  As a result, significant year-to-year changes in 
interest rates can cause material year-to-year changes in assumed discount 
rates and employee benefit liabilities and costs based on these rates.  If 
the health care cost trend rates were increased by one percentage point, the 
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, as of December 31, 1995, would 
increase by approximately $98 million while the net postretirement benefit 
cost for the year then ended would increase by approximately $8 million.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112.  The obligation 
for continuing operations as of January 1, 1993 was recognized as a 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $92 million 
after-tax.  Adoption of SFAS No. 112 did not have a material effect on the 
Company's earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
principle.

STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

The 1995 and 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plans provide for a variety 
of awards to employees.  Some of these awards are based upon performance 
criteria relating to the Company established by the Executive Compensation 
and Development Committee of the Board of Directors.

The 1995 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan provides that options can be 
granted through December 31, 1999, to employees for the purchase of up to 
16,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an option price not less 
than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the stock 
option's grant.  The 1995 Plan also provides for the granting of Stock 
Appreciation Rights (SARs) either in tandem with options or freestanding.  
SARs allow optionees to receive a payment equal to the appreciation in market 
value of a stated number of shares of the Company's common stock from the 
SAR's exercise price to the market value on the date of its exercise.  
Exercise of a tandem SAR requires the optionee to surrender the related 
option.  At December 31, 1995, there were 163,061 freestanding SARs 
outstanding at the option price of $56.31.

The 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan provides that options can be 
granted through January 31, 1995, to key employees for the purchase of up to 
16,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an option price not less 
than 50 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the stock 
option's grant.  No options below fair market value have been granted to 
date.  Options with dividend equivalents were awarded during 1994, 1993 and 
1992 under the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan.  Provisions under 
this plan amounted to $4 million in 1995, $6 million in 1994 and $5 million in 
1993.  The 1990 Plan also provides for the granting of SARs either in tandem 
with options or freestanding.  At December 31, 1995, there were 167,915 
tandem SARs and 397,414 freestanding SARs outstanding at option prices 
ranging from $31.45 to $44.50.

The 1985 Stock Option Plan provided that options could be granted through 
1989 to key employees for the purchase of up to 6,000,000 (prior to giving 
effect to the 3-for-2 partial stock split in 1987) shares of the Company's 
common stock at an option price not less than the per share fair market value 
at the time the option was granted.  Options granted have maximum durations 
of 7 or 10 years from the date of grant but may expire sooner if the 
optionee's employment terminates.  The 1985 Plan also provided for the 
granting of SARs either in tandem with options or freestanding.  At December 
31, 1995, there were 410,954 tandem SARs and 47,847 freestanding SARs 
outstanding at option prices ranging from $33.79 to $39.53. 

Summarized option data as of December 31, 1995 are as follows:

ACQUISITION OF REMAINING SHARES OF QUALEX

In August 1994, the Company acquired the remaining shares of Qualex, a 
photofinisher operating primarily in the U.S., for $150 million with a 
combination of cash and a note. Prior to August 12, 1994, the Company had an 
investment in Qualex of approximately fifty percent of its outstanding common 
shares, which was accounted for under the equity method.

(1)  After deducting $340 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $254 million, and a $110 million loss on the extinguishment of 
     certain financial instruments, which reduced net earnings by $80 million.  Net earnings 
     were also reduced by $266 million of extraordinary losses related to the early 
     extinguishment of debt.
(2)  After deducting $495 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $353 million, and $55 million of restructuring costs from 
     discontinued operations, which reduced net earnings by $34 million.
(3)  The net loss for 1993 was due to an after-tax charge of $2.17 billion from the cumulative 
     effect of adopting SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 
     Than Pensions," and SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."
(4)  After deducting $219 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $140 million, and $1 million of restructuring costs from 
     discontinued operations, which reduced net earnings by less than $1 million.
(5)  Net earnings for 1992 benefited by $152 million from the cumulative effect of adopting  
     SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
(6)  After deducting $1,448 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $934 million, and $157 million of restructuring costs from 
     discontinued operations, which reduced net earnings by $98 million.
(7)  Based on average number of shares outstanding.
(8)  The lower dividends in 1994 and 1995 were due to the spin-off of the Eastman Chemical 
     Company operations at year-end 1993.  As a result of the spin-off, the Company's 
     shareowners received one share of Eastman Chemical Company stock for every four shares of 
     Kodak common stock.
(9)  The acquisition of Qualex during 1994 added approximately 7,600 people to the Company's 
     U.S. employment.  Acquisitions outside the U.S. during 1994 added approximately 1,200 
     people to the Company's employment levels.  Approximately 5,100 personnel left the Company 
     during 1994 under restructuring programs.

EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY

RETIREMENT PLAN FOR DIRECTORS


1.   Name and Purpose

     This plan shall be known as the Eastman Kodak Company 
Retirement Plan for Directors (the "Plan").  Its 
purpose is to provide retirement income benefits for 
certain Directors of Eastman Kodak Company (the 
"Company") upon completion of their service as 
Directors of the Company.

2.   Eligibility

     Each Director of the Company who is not in the regular 
employ of the Company (including those who may have 
been so employed previously by the Company) shall be 
eligible to participate in this Plan.

3.   Effective Date

     This Plan shall become effective June 1, 1984.

4.   Annual Retainer

     When used in this Plan, "Annual Retainer" shall mean 
the total annual retainer whether in cash, stock or 
restricted stock received or deferred by a Director for 
service as a member of the Board.  For purposes of this 
Plan all shares of common stock paid as retainer shall 
be valued as of the date on which such shares were 
granted.

5.   Benefit

     a)  Amount of Benefit.  On January 1 and July 1 of each 
year, commencing with the first such date following (i) 
termination of service as a Director or (ii) such 
participant's 65th birthday, whichever occurs later, a 
semi-annual payment shall be paid to each eligible 
participant.  That payment shall be equal to one-half 
of the Annual Retainer multiplied by a fraction the 
numerator of which shall be the number of months during 
which such participant served as a Director not in the 
regular employ of the Company, but in no event greater 
than sixty (60) and the denominator of which shall be 
sixty (60).  Service will be measured from the 
effective date of election to membership on the Board 
of Directors of Eastman Kodak Company (the "Board") to 
the date of termination of such membership except that
the service of a Director who had previously been in 
the regular employ of the Company shall be deemed to 
have commenced on the date such employment terminated.  
Service for any portion of a month shall be deemed to 
be service for a full month.  Payments commenced 
hereunder will be suspended if and when the participant 
is reelected as a Director and recomputed and 
recommenced upon subsequent termination of service as a 
Director.

                                                                  <PAGE> 54

b)   Pre-1/1/96 Directors.  The terms of this paragraph 
5 (b) shall apply only to those participants whose 
service as a Director commenced prior to January 1, 
1996.

    i) Term of Benefit.  The semi-annual benefit 
    computed under paragraph 5 (a) above shall 
    continue to be paid to the participant until 
    the date of his or her death.

    ii) Adjustments to Annual Retainer.  Whenever 
    the Annual Retainer to Directors of the 
    Company who are not in the regular employ of 
    the Company is changed, the Annual Retainer 
    used to compute the participant's payment 
    under paragraph 5 (a) above shall be adjusted 
    by a like amount.  The adjustment shall be 
    effective for all payments made on or after 
    the effective date of such change in the 
    Annual Retainer. 

c)  Post-12/31/95 Directors.  The terms of this 
paragraph 5 (c) shall apply only to those 
participants whose service as a Director commenced 
on or after January 1, 1996.



    i)  Term of Benefit.  The semi-annual benefit 
    computed under paragraph 5 (a) above shall 
    continue to be paid to the participant until 
    the earlier of: (A) his or her "Benefit 
    Termination Date"; or (B) the date of his or 
    her death.  For purposes of this paragraph 
    5(c)(i), a participant's "Benefit Termination 
    Date" shall mean the date upon which the 
    participant receives in the aggregate that 
    number of payments equal to the number 
    obtained by dividing the number of months 
    during which such participant served as a 
    Director not in the employ of the Company by 
    six (6).  For purposes of this calculation, 
    service shall be measured in accordance with 
    the terms of paragraph 5 (a) above.  To the 
    extent this calculation produces other than a 
    whole number, any decimal equal to or in 
    excess of .5 (five tenths) shall be rounded to 
    the next nearest whole number and any decimal 
    less than .5 (five tenths) shall be ignored.

    ii) Annual Retainer.  The Annual Retainer that 
    shall be used to compute the participant's 
    payment under paragraph 5 (a) shall be the 
    Annual Retainer in effect on the date of the 
    participant's termination of service as a 
    Director.

6.  Amendment and Termination

     This Plan may be amended or terminated by the Board at 
any time for any reason.

7.   Miscellaneous

     a)   Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed 
as a contract of employment between the Company and a 
Director.

     b)   The benefits payable under this Plan shall not be 
assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered or be 
subject in any manner to alienation or anticipation.

     c)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, 
any Director who is removed from the Board for cause, 
shall not be entitled to any benefit hereunder.



8.   Change in Control

     a)   For purposes of this Plan, "Change In Control" 
means a change in control of the Company of a nature 
that would be required to be reported (assuming such 
event has not been "previously reported") in response 
to Item 1(a) of the Current Report on Form 8-K, as in 
effect on March 1, 1990, pursuant to Section 13 or 
15(d) of the Exchange Act; provided that, without 
limitation, a Change In Control shall be deemed to have 
occurred at such time as (i) any "person" within the 
meaning of Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act, other than 
the Company, a subsidiary of the Company, or any 
employee benefit plan(s) sponsored by the Company or any 
subsidiary of the Company, is or has become the 
"beneficial owner," as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 
Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, of 25% or more of 
the combined voting power of the outstanding securities 
of the Company ordinarily having the right to vote at 
the election of directors, or (ii) individuals who 
constitute the Board of Directors on March 1, 1990 (the 
"Incumbent Board") have ceased for any reason to 
constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that 
any person becoming a director subsequent to March 1,
1990 whose election, or nomination for election by the 
Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at 
least three-quarters (3/4) of the directors comprising 
the Incumbent Board (either by a specific vote or by 
approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which 
such person is named as a nominee for director without 
objection to such nomination) shall be, for purposes of 
this Plan, considered as though such person were a 
member of the Incumbent Board.

     b)   Background.  Upon a Change In Control:  (i) the 
terms of this paragraph 8 shall immediately become 
operative, without further action or consent by any 
person or entity; (ii) all terms, conditions, 
restrictions, and limitations in effect on any 
participant's benefit accrued as of the date of the 
Change In Control, regardless of whether payments have 
commenced to such participant ("Accrued Benefit"), 
shall immediately lapse as of the date of such event; 
(iii) no other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or 
limitations shall be imposed upon any Accrued Benefit 
on or after such date, and in no circumstance shall an 
Accrued Benefit be forfeited on or after such date; 
(iv) all Accrued Benefits shall automatically become 
one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately.

     c)   Valuation of Benefit.  Upon a Change In Control, a 
participant's benefit shall be determined using the 
annual retainer in effect on the date the Change In 
Control occurs.

     d)   Payment of Benefit.  Upon a Change In Control, any 
participant, whether or not he/she is still a director 
of the Company, shall be paid his/her Accrued Benefit 
in a single lump-sum cash payment equal to the present 
value of the Accrued Benefit.  If a participant is 
receiving payment of his/her Accrued Benefit at the time 
of the Change In Control, the remaining portion of such 
Accrued Benefit shall be paid in a single lump-sum cash 
payment equal to the present value of the remaining 
benefit.  Payment of the Accrued Benefit shall be made 
as soon as practical but in no event later than 90 days 
after the Change In Control.  Present value 
calculations shall be made by an independent actuary 
selected by the Company.

     e)   Miscellaneous.  Upon a Change In Control, no 
action, including, but not by way of limitation, the 
amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan, 
shall be taken which would affect the rights of any 
participant or the operation of the Plan with respect 
to any Accrued Benefit to which the participant may 
have become entitled hereunder on or prior to the date 
of such action or as a result of such Change In 
Control.

Preamble. The 1982 Eastman Kodak Company Executive Deferred 
Compensation Plan is an unfunded non-qualified deferred 
compensation arrangement for eligible executives of Eastman 
Kodak Company and certain of its subsidiaries effective for 
compensation earned in 1982 and later years.  Under the 
Plan, each Eligible Employee is annually given an 
opportunity to elect to defer payment of part of his or her 
compensation earned during the year following his or her 
election.


Section 1.     Definitions.

Section 1.1.  "Account" means the Deferred Compensation 
Account or the Stock Account.

Section 1.2.  "Board" means Board of Directors of 
Kodak.

Section 1.3.  "Change in Control" means a change in 
control of Kodak of a nature that would be required to 
be reported (assuming such event has not been 
"previously reported") in response to Item 1(a) of the 
Current Report of Form 8-K, as in effect on August 1, 
1989, pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); 
provided that, without limitation, a Change in Control 
shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as (i) 
any "person" within the meaning of Section 14(d) of the 
Exchange Act is or has become the "beneficial owner" as 
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, directly 
or indirectly, of 25% or more of the combined voting 
power of the outstanding securities of Kodak ordinarily
having the right to vote at the election of directors 
("Voting Securities"), or (ii) individuals who 
constitute the Board of Directors of Kodak on August 1, 
1989 (the "Incumbent Board") have ceased for any reason 
to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided 
that any person becoming a director subsequent to 
August 1, 1989 whose election, or nomination for 
election by Kodak's stockholders, was approved by a 
vote of at least three-quarters (3/4) of the directors 
comprising the Incumbent Board (either by a specific 
vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the 
Company in which such person is named as a nominee for 
director without objection to such nomination) shall 
be, for purposes of this clause (ii), considered as 
though such person were a member of the Incumbent 
Board.

Section 1.4.  "Common Stock" means the common stock of 
Kodak.

Section 1.5.  "Company" means Kodak and its United 
States subsidiaries listed on Schedule A.

Compensation Committee.  However, in no event shall a 
non-resident alien be eligible to participate in this

designated by the Compensation Committee each year,

trading day, the immediately preceding day.

Section 1.14.   "Plan" means the 1982 Eastman Kodak 
Company Executive Deferred Compensation Plan as adopted 
by the Board and amended.

    Amount to be earned during the immediately 
    succeeding calendar year;

    2)    all or any portion of his or her Award, if any, 
    under the Wage Dividend Plan payable in the 
    immediately succeeding calendar year; and

    3)    all or any portion of any other compensation 
    identified by the Compensation Committee.

An Eligible Employee may not defer the receipt of any

Section 4.     Time of Election of Deferral.

Section 4.1.   In General.  Except as set forth in 
Section 4.2, an Eligible Employee who wishes to 
defer compensation must irrevocably elect to do so 
during the Enrollment Period immediately preceding 
the calendar year during which such compensation 
is paid.  Elections made during the Enrollment 
Period shall be effective the first day of the 
calendar year immediately following the Enrollment 
Period.  Elections shall be made annually.

Section 4.2.   Newly Eligible Employees.  An 
Eligible Employee who is hired by the Company 
during a calendar year may elect to defer 
compensation earned during the remainder of such 
year by filing an election in accordance with the 
terms of this Section 4.2.  Such election must be 
filed by the Eligible Employee with the 
Compensation Committee within ten business days of 
the first day of the Eligible Employee's 
employment with the Company.  Notwithstanding any 
provision of this Plan to the contrary, such 
election shall only be effective with respect to 
the Eligible Employee's: (i) base salary, 
beginning with the first pay period following the
pay period in which the election is filed with the 
Compensation Committee; and (ii) any award to 
which he or she may be entitled under the 
Management Variable Compensation Plan, or any 
successor plan thereto, for services performed 
during the calendar year of his or her hire.  By 
way of an administrative rule, the Compensation 
Committee may impose such additional requirements 
upon a newly Eligible Employee's election, 
including, but not limited to, a minimum level of 
deferral, as it determines in the exercise of its 
sole and absolute discretion.


Section 5.     Hypothetical Investments.  

Section 5.1.  Deferred Compensation Account.  Amounts 
in a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account are 
hypothetically invested in an interest bearing account 
which bears interest computed at the Interest Rate, 
compounded monthly.

Section 5.2.  Stock Account.  Amounts in a SOG 
Participant's Stock Account are hypothetically invested 
in units of Common Stock.  Amounts transferred to a 
Stock Account are recorded as units of Common Stock, 
and fractions thereof, with one unit equating to a 
single share of Common Stock.  Thus, the value of one 
unit shall be the Market Value of a single share of Common 
Stock.  The use of units is merely a bookkeeping 
convenience; the units are not actual shares of Common 
Stock.  The Company will not reserve or otherwise set 
aside any Common Stock for or to any Stock Account.

Section 6.     Manner of Electing Deferral.  An Eligible 
Employee may elect to defer compensation by executing 
and returning to the Compensation Committee a deferred 
compensation form provided by Kodak.  The form shall 
indicate: (1) the amount of the Deferrable Amount to be 
deferred; (2) whether the deferral is to be at the same 
rate throughout the year, or at one rate for part of the 
year and at a second rate for the remainder of the year; 
(3) whether or not the wage dividend eligible to be 
deferred is to be deferred; and (4) the portion of any 
other compensation identified by the Compensation 
Committee to be deferred.

Amounts to be deferred shall be credited to the 
Participant's Deferred Compensation Account as follows:

    1)    Deferrable Amount shall be credited 
    each pay period on the date such amount 
    is otherwise payable; 

    2)    wage dividend shall be credited on 
    the date such amount is otherwise 
    payable; 
    and

    3)    any other compensation shall be 
    credited on the date such amount is 
    otherwise payable.


Section 7.     Elections to Defer For a Fixed Period During 
Employment.  A Participant may elect to defer receipt of his 
or her compensation for a fixed number of years, no less 
than 5, provided he or she continues as an employee of the 
Company during the period of deferral.  Any such election 
shall be made during the Enrollment Period on the deferred 
compensation form referenced in Section 6 above.  If such 
Participant ceases to be an employee of the Company prior to 
the end of the fixed period, Section 9 shall govern the 
payment of his or her Accounts.

If a Participant has elected to defer receipt of his or her 
compensation for a fixed number of years, payment of such 
amount shall be made in cash in a single lump-sum on the 
fifth business day in March in the year following the 
termination of the deferral period.  The amount of the lump- 
sum due the Participant shall be valued as of the Valuation 
Date in February in the year following the termination of 
the deferral period.

Section 8.     Investment in the Stock Account.

Section 8.1.  Elections. A SOG Participant may direct 
that all or any portion, designated as a whole dollar 
amount, of the existing balance of one of his or her 
Accounts be transferred to his or her other Account, 
effective as of the close of business on the last day 
of any calendar month (hereinafter the election's 
"Effective Date"), by filing a written election with 
the Compensation Committee on or prior to such date.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 
8.1, a SOG Participant may not transfer to his or her 
Stock Account any amount subject to an election to 
defer for a fixed number of years pursuant to Section 
7, nor may he or she transfer to his or her Stock 
Account any interest that has accrued on such amount.

Section 8.2.  Election into the Stock Account.  If a 
SOG Participant elects pursuant to Section 8.1 to 
transfer an amount from his or her Deferred 
Compensation Account to his or her Stock Account, 
effective as of the election's Effective Date, (i) his 
or her Stock Account shall be credited with that number 
of units of Common Stock, and fractions thereof, 
obtained by dividing the dollar amount elected to be 
transferred by the Market Value of the Common Stock on 
the Valuation Date immediately preceding the election's 
Effective Date; and (ii) his or her Deferred 
Compensation Account shall be reduced by the amount
elected to be transferred.

Section 8.3.  Election out of the Stock Account.  If a 
SOG Participant elects pursuant to Section 8.1 to 
transfer an amount from his or her Stock Account to his 
or her Deferred Compensation Account, effective as of 
the election's Effective Date, (i) his or her Deferred 
Compensation Account shall be credited with a dollar 
amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the 
number of units to be transferred by the Market Value 
of the Common Stock on the Valuation Date immediately 
preceding the election's Effective Date; and (ii) his 
or her Stock account shall be reduced by the number of 
units elected to be transferred.

Section 8.4.  Dividend Equivalents.  Effective as of 
the payment date for each cash dividend on the Common 
Stock, additional units of Common Stock shall be 
credited to the Stock Account of each SOG Participant 
who had a balance in his or her Stock Account on the 
record date for such dividend.  The number of units 
that shall be credited to the Stock Account of such a 
SOG Participant shall be computed by multiplying the 
dollar value of the dividend paid upon a single share 
of Common Stock by the number of units of Common Stock 
held in the SOG Participant's Stock Account on the 
record date for such dividend and dividing the product 
thereof by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the 
payment date for such dividend.

                                                                   <PAGE> 66

Section 8.5.  Stock Dividends.  Effective as of the 
payment date for each stock dividend (as defined in 
Section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) on the 
Common Stock, additional units of Common Stock shall be 
credited to the Stock Account of each SOG Participant 
who had a balance in his or her Stock Account on the 
record date for such dividend.  The number of units that 
shall be credited to the Stock Account of such a SOG 
Participant shall equal the number of shares of Common 
Stock which the SOG Participant would have received as 
stock dividends had he or she been the owner on the 
record date for such stock dividend of the number of 
shares of Common Stock equal to the number of units 
credited to his or her Stock Account on such record 
date.  To the extent the SOG Participant would have also 
received cash, in lieu of fractional shares of Common 
Stock, had he or she been the record owner of such 
shares for such stock dividend, then his or her Stock 
Account shall also be credited with that number of 
units, or fractions thereof, equal to such cash amount 
divided by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the 
payment date for such dividend.

Section 8.6.  Recapitalization.  If Kodak undergoes a
reorganization as defined in Section 368 (a) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Compensation 
Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion, take 
whatever action it deems necessary, advisable or 
appropriate with respect to the Stock Accounts in order 
to reflect such transaction, including, but not limited 
to, adjusting the number of units credited to a SOG 
Participant's Stock Account.

Section 8.7.  Distributions.  Amounts in respect of 
units of Common Stock shall be distributed in cash in 
accordance with Sections 7, 9, 10, 11 and 22.  For 
purposes of a distribution pursuant to Section 7, 9, 
10, 11 or 22, the number of units to be distributed 
from a SOG Participant's Stock Account shall be valued 
by multiplying the number of such units by the Market 
Value of the Common Stock as of the Valuation Date 
immediately preceding the date such distribution is to 
occur.  Pending the complete distribution under Section 
9.2 or liquidation under Section 8.8 of the Stock 
Account of a SOG Participant who has terminated his or 
her employment with the Company, the SOG Participant 
shall continue to be able to make elections pursuant to 
Sections 8.2 and 8.3 and his or her Stock Account shall 
continue to be credited with additional units of Common 
Stock pursuant to Sections 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6.

Section 8.8.  Liquidation of Stock Account.  The 
provisions of this Section 8.8 shall be applicable if 
on the second anniversary of the SOG Participant's 
retirement or, if earlier, termination of employment 
from the Company, the SOG Participant has a balance 
remaining in his or her Stock Account.  In such case, 
effective as of the first day of the first calendar 
month immediately following the date of such second 
anniversary, the entire balance of the SOG 
Participant's Stock Account shall automatically be 
transferred to his or her Deferred Compensation Account 
and, he or she shall thereafter be ineligible to 
transfer any amounts to his or her Stock Account.  For 
purposes of valuing the units of Common Stock subject 
to such a transfer, the method described in Section 8.3 
shall be used.


Section 9.     Payment of Deferred Compensation.  

Section 9.1.  Background.  No withdrawal may be made 
from a Participant's Accounts except as provided in 
this Section 9 and Sections 7, 10, 11, and 22.

Section 9.2.  Manner of Payment.  Payment of a 
Participant's Accounts shall be made at the sole 
discretion of the Committee in a single sum or in 
annual installments.  The maximum number of 
installments is ten.  All payments from the Plan shall
be made in cash.

Section 9.3.  Timing of Payments.  Payments shall be 
made on the fifth business day in March and shall 
commence in any year designated by the Compensation 
Committee up through the tenth year following the year 
in which the Participant retires, becomes disabled, or 
for any other reason, ceases to be an employee of Kodak 
or any subsidiary of Kodak, but in no event later than 
the year the Participant reaches age 71.

Section 9.4.  Valuation.  The amount of each payment 
shall be equal to the value, as of the immediately 
preceding Valuation Date, of the Participant's 
Accounts, divided by the number of installments 
remaining to be paid.  If payment of a Participant's 
Accounts is determined by the Compensation Committee to 
be paid in installments and the Participant has a 
balance in his or her Stock Account at the time of the 
payment of an installment, the amount that shall be 
distributed from his or her Stock Account shall be the 
amount obtained by multiplying the total amount of the 
installment determined in accordance with the 
immediately preceding sentence by the percentage 
obtained by dividing the balance in the Stock Account 
as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date by the 
total value of the Participant's Accounts as of such 
date.  Similarly, in such case, the amount that shall 
be distributed from the Participant's Deferred 
Compensation Account shall be the amount obtained by 
multiplying the total amount of the installment 
determined in accordance with the first sentence of this 
Section 9.4 by the percentage obtained by dividing the 
balance in the Deferred Compensation Account as of the 
immediately preceding Valuation Date by the total value 
of the Participant's Accounts as of such date.

Section 9.5.  Termination of Employment.  Anything 
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Participants 
who cease to be employed by Kodak or any Subsidiary of 
Kodak and are employed by Eastman Chemical Company or 
one of its subsidiaries in connection with the 
distribution of the common stock of Eastman Chemical 
Company to the shareholders of Kodak, shall not be 
deemed to have terminated employment for purposes of 
this Plan.


Section 10.    Payment of Deferred Compensation After Death.  
If a Participant dies prior to complete payment of his or her 
Accounts, the provisions of this Section 10 shall become 
operative.

Section 10.1.  Stock Account.  Effective as of the date 
of a SOG Participant's death, the entire balance of his
or her Stock Account shall be transferred to his or her 
Deferred Compensation Account.  For purposes of valuing 
the units of Common Stock subject to such a transfer, 
the deceased SOG Participant's Deferred Compensation 
Account shall be credited with a dollar amount equal to 
the amount obtained by multiplying the number of units 
in the deceased SOG Participant's Stock Account at the 
time of his or her death by the Market Value of the 
Common Stock on the date of his or her death.  
Thereafter, no amounts in the deceased SOG 
Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be 
eligible for transfer to the deceased SOG Participant's 
Stock Account by any person, including, but not by way 
of limitation, the deceased SOG Participant's 
beneficiary or legal representative.

Section 10.2.  Distribution.  The balance of the 
Participant's Accounts, valued as of the Valuation Date 
immediately preceding the date payment is made, shall 
be paid in a single, lump-sum payment to: (1) the 
beneficiary or contingent beneficiary designated by the 
Participant on forms supplied by the Compensation 
Committee; or, in the absence of a valid designation of 
a beneficiary or contingent beneficiary, (2) the 
Participant's estate within 30 days after appointment 
of a legal representative of the deceased Participant.

                                                                   <PAGE> 69

Section 11.    Acceleration of Payment for Hardship.  Upon 
written approval from Kodak's Chairman of the Board (the 
Compensation Committee, in the case of a request from the 
Chairman of the Board) a Participant, whether or not he or 
she is still employed by Kodak or any subsidiary of Kodak, 
may be permitted to receive all or part of his or her 
Accounts if the Chairman of the Board (or the Compensation 
Committee, when applicable) determines that an emergency 
event beyond the Participant's control exists which would 
cause such Participant severe financial hardship if the 
payment of his or her Accounts were not approved.  Any such 
distribution for hardship shall be limited to the amount 
needed to meet such emergency.  If such a distribution 
occurs while the Participant is employed by Kodak or any 
subsidiary of Kodak, any election to defer compensation for 
the year in which the Participant receives a hardship 
withdrawal shall be ineffective as to compensation earned for 
the pay period following the pay period during which the 
withdrawal is made and thereafter for the remainder of such 
year and shall be ineffective as to any wage dividend or any 
other compensation elected to be deferred for such year.


Section 12.    Non-Competition Provision.  If a Participant, 
without the written consent of Kodak, engages either 
directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, as 
principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, or 
otherwise, in any business or activity competitive with the 
business conducted by Kodak or any subsidiary of Kodak,
while a balance remains credited to his or her Account, the 
Company may, in its sole discretion, pay to the Participant 
the balance credited to his or her Deferred Compensation 
Account and/or Stock Account.


Section 13.    Participant's Rights Unsecured.  The amounts 
payable under the Plan shall be unfunded, and the right of 
any Participant or his or her estate to receive any payment 
under the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the 
general assets of the Company.  No Participant shall have 
the right to exercise any of the rights or privileges of a 
shareholder with respect to the units credited to his or her 
Stock Account.


Section 14.    No Right to Continued Employment.  
Participation in the Plan shall not give any employee any 
right to remain in the employ of the Company.  The Company 
reserves the right to terminate any Participant at any 
time.


Section 15.    Statement of Account.  Statements will be 
sent no less frequently than annually to each Participant or 
his or her estate showing the value of the Participant's 
Accounts.

Section 16.    Assignability.  Neither the Participant nor 
the Company shall have the right to assign any rights or 
obligations under the Plan.  However, the Plan shall inure 
to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors of the 
Company.


Section 17.    Deductions.  The Company will withhold to the 
extent required by law all applicable income and employment 
taxes from amounts paid under the Plan.


Section 18.    Administration.  

Section 18.1.  Responsibility.  The Compensation 
Committee shall have total and exclusive responsibility 
to control, operate, manage and administer the plan in 
accordance with its terms.

Section 18.2.  Authority of the Compensation Committee.  
The Compensation Committee shall have all the authority 
that may be necessary or helpful to enable it to 
discharge its responsibilities with respect to the 
Plan.  Without limiting the generality of the preceding 
sentence, the Compensation Committee shall have the 
exclusive right: to interpret the Plan, to determine 
eligibility for participation in the Plan, to decide 
all question concerning eligibility for and the amount 
of benefits payable under the Plan, to construe any 
ambiguous provision of the Plan, to correct any 
default, to supply any omission, to reconcile any 
inconsistency, and to decide any and all questions 
arising in the administration, interpretation, and

KODAK UNFUNDED RETIREMENT INCOME PLAN



ARTICLE ONE

Purpose of Plan

1.1  This Plan implements the intent of providing retirement 
benefits by means of both a funded and an unfunded 
plan.  This Plan is maintained primarily for the purpose 
of providing deferred compensation for a select group of 
management or highly compensated employees as described 
in section 201(2) of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 and is designed to provide 
retirement benefits payable out of the general assets 
of the Company where benefits cannot be paid under the 
Funded Plan because of Code section 401(a)(17) and the 
provisions of the Funded Plan which implement such 
section and/or because deferred compensation is ignored 
in defining compensation for purposes of calculating 
benefits under the Funded Plan.


ARTICLE TWO

Definitions

2.1  "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended from time to time.

2.2  "Company" shall mean Eastman Kodak Company, which 
effective October 1, 1994 shall include the Nano 
Systems division, and any subsidiary and/or affiliated
corporation which is a participating employer under the 
Funded Plan other than those covered by Appendix I of 
the Funded Plan, except where a specific reference is 
made to a particular corporation.

2.3  "Effective Date" shall mean September 1, 1990.

2.4  "Employee" shall mean a participant in the Funded Plan.

2.5  "Funded Plan" shall mean the Kodak Retirement Income 
Plan.

Plan.

                                                                   <PAGE> 77

ARTICLE THREE

Eligibility

3.1    All Employees eligible to receive a benefit from the Funded 
Plan shall be eligible to receive a benefit under this Plan if they 
have deferred any portion of their compensation pursuant to a duly 
authorized and executed deferred compensation agreement or plan and/or 
their benefit cannot be fully provided by the Funded Plan due to the 
compensation limitations imposed by Code section 401(a)(17).


ARTICLE FOUR

Benefits

4.1    Benefits due under this Plan shall be paid at such time or 
times following the Employee's termination of employment or death as 
the Company's Director of Compensation and Benefits, or his designee, 
or in the absence or personal involvement of such Director or 
designee, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources, may select, in 
his sole discretion, from among the options available under the Funded 
Plan.

4.2    The benefit payable under this Plan shall be the amount of the 
retirement income benefit to which an Employee 
would otherwise be entitled under the Funded Plan,

       (i)   if deferred compensation were included in the Funded 
             Plan's definitions of "Participating Compensation" and 
             "Retirement Annual Salary Rate";

       (ii)  if the provisions of section 401(a)(17) of the Code, as 
             expressed in the Funded Plan, were disregarded; and

       (iii) if a minimum award at the target award ("C" level) under 
             the Eastman Kodak Company Management Annual Performance 
             Plan ("MAPP") is deemed included in the 1992 
             "Participating Compensation" of any such Employee who -

             (a)  is a part of the "Transition Workforce" under the 
                  Kodak Resource Redeployment and Retirement Program,

             (b)  retires on or after May 1, 1992, and

             (c)  receives an actual award under the MAPP in 1992, 
                  which is lower than the target award ("C" level);

<PAGE>
                                                                   <PAGE> 78

less the combined amounts of the retirement income 
benefit to which the Employee is entitled under the 
Funded Plan and the retirement income benefit to which 
such Employee is entitled under the Kodak Excess 
Retirement Income Plan.

The "retirement income benefit to which the Employee is 
entitled under the Funded Plan" generally means the 
benefits actually payable to an Employee under the 
Funded Plan; provided, however, that where the benefits 
actually payable to an Employee under the Funded Plan 
are reduced on account of a payment of all or a portion 
of an Employee's benefits to a third party on behalf of 
or with respect to an Employee (pursuant, for example, 
to a domestic relations order), the "retirement income 
benefit to which the Employee is entitled under the 
Funded Plan" shall be deemed to mean the benefit that 
would have been actually payable but for such payment 
to a third party.

4.3  If an Employee's benefit from the Funded Plan is 
subject to an actuarial reduction because of the time 
when payment commences, his benefit from this Plan 
shall also be actuarially reduced.

4.4  The benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid by 
the Company each year out of its general assets and 
shall not be otherwise funded.

4.5  If a Participant's benefit under the Funded Plan is 
greater than it would otherwise be because of the 
provisions of Section 5.06(d), the Participant's benefit 
under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of
such excess.


ARTICLE FIVE
Administration


5.1  This Plan shall be administered by KRIPCO in accordance 
with its terms and purposes.

5.2  KRIPCO shall have full discretionary authority to 
determine eligibility, to construe and interpret the 
terms of the Plan, including the power to remedy 
possible ambiguities, inconsistencies or omissions, or 
to determine the benefits due each Employee from this 
and the Funded Plan and shall cause them to be paid 
accordingly.

5.3  The decisions made by and the actions taken by KRIPCO 
in the administration of the Plan shall be final and 
conclusive on all persons, and the members of KRIPCO 
shall not be subject to individual liability with 
respect to this Plan.

conjunction with the Funded Plan for as long as 
necessary, the Company reserves the right to amend 
and/or terminate it at any time for whatever reasons it 
may deem advisable.

6.2  Notwithstanding the preceding Section, however, the 
Company hereby makes a contractual commitment to pay 
the benefits accrued under this Plan to the extent it 
is financially capable of meeting such obligation.


ARTICLE SEVEN

Miscellaneous

7.1  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a 
contract of employment between the Company and an 
Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued 
in the employment of the Company, or as a limitation of 
the right of the Company to discharge any of its 
Employees, with or without cause.

        from a part-time class to a full-time class described

        described above, the hours component of IASR is adjusted 
        as of the date of such reclassification for determining 
        benefits and premiums. 
 
    (d) Because the individual rate for certain commission- 
        eligible employees is reduced below the normal rate for

        calculating factor for the appropriate commission plan 
        specified in Kodak Commission Compensation Plan  
        (Compensation Plan No. 2C1). 
 
    (e) Because the base salary rate for each Employee eligible 
        for certain management performance incentives is reduced

        be in the absence of the reduction under the management 
        performance incentive arrangement.

LTD Recipient is not a Retiree.  The term "pension plan of the 
Company" as used in the previous sentence means the Kodak 
Retirement Income Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1R.01) or other 
retirement plan of the Company that is a defined-benefit pension 
plan intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Internal 
Revenue Code. 
 
2.22  Service, Continuous Service, Adjusted Service 
 
"Service," as used in this Plan, means the elapsed days, months, 
and years since the Employee's Adjusted Employment Date. 
 
"Continuous Service" is the period of elapsed days, months, and 
years of Service which has not been interrupted since the 
Employee's Current Employment Date, including but not limited to
Service with an Affiliate recognized by Kodak.  The resumption of 
employment immediately following a Leave of Absence, military 
service, or the College Cooperative Intern program means that 
Continuous Service has not been interrupted. 
 
"Adjusted Service" is the aggregate of days, months, and years of 
Service credit resulting from the linkage of the current span of 
employment with one or more spans of prior Service which have 
qualified for reinstatement.  (Thirty days equate to one month; 
twelve months equate to one year.)  The qualification for Service 
reinstatement is established by the leaving reason assigned to 
the prior Service span.  Within the controlled group of Kodak 
corporations, Adjusted Service includes any service recognized by 
any affiliated company unless preempted by contractual 
agreements.

Furthermore, Service of certain Employees will be adjusted as 
indicated in Appendix A. 
 
Note that each Employee who was an active employee of Wilson & Geo. Meyer
& Co. on the day before the date he or she became an Employee, will be 
credited with Service as though such person had been an Employee 
during the entire period of his or her employment with Wilson & Geo. Meyer
& Co.

<PAGE>
                                                                  <PAGE> 88
       
       b)  LTD Recipients.  LTD Recipients who were covered 
           under the SGLI Plan on the effective date of their 
           disability and have been covered on a continuous 
           basis since that date. 
 
       c)  Retirees.  Retirees who were covered under the SGLI 
           Plan on a continuous basis since the date which they 
           first became eligible for coverage through their 
           effective date of retirement.  However, anyone who 
           was a Key Employee on or after January 1, 1984, and 
           who was not age 55 or older on that date may not 
           participate in the SGLI Plan after December 31, 
           1986. 
 
 
4.   AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AND COST 
 
4.1  Coverage for Employees and LTD Recipients 
 
The amount of SGLI for a covered Employee is 2.0 times his 
IASR.  The amount of coverage for any covered Employee will 
never be reduced except in the case of a decrease in IASR 
because of a general wage decrease. 
 
If a covered Employee becomes an LTD Recipient, the amount of 
coverage in force immediately before the effective date of 
disability will be continued for the duration of the 
disability.  
 
4.2  Coverage for Retirees 
 
If a Subscriber becomes a Retiree prior to age 65 following the 
completion of 10 or more years of service, SGLI coverage will 
be continued in full through age 65.  The coverage in effect at 
age 65 will be reduced in five equal decrements on the first of 
the month following each of the Retiree's 66th through 70th 
birthdays. 
 
The amount of the reduction varies according to the Retiree's 
years of service.  The level of coverage at age 70 and later is 
expressed as a percentage of the coverage in effect at age 65 
as shown in the following table: 
 
                                 Coverage at Age 70 
                                 as a Percentage of 
  Years of Service               Coverage at Age 65* 
 
          10                                 25% 
          11                                 27 1/2% 
          12                                 30% 
          13                                 32 1/2% 
          14                                 35% 
          15                                 37 1/2% 
          16                                 40% 
          17                                 42 1/2% 
          18                                 45% 
          19                                 47 1/2% 
          20 or more                         50% 


   *Coverage in retirement will be based on the higher of: 
 
      (1) the amount of coverage at age 65, or 
      (2) the amount of coverage at retirement. 
  
<PAGE>

                                                                   <PAGE> 89

     The higher of these two amounts will be multiplied by the 
appropriate percentage from this column (the percentage used 
is that corresponding to the Subscriber's years of service, 
prorated for partial years). 
 
If retirement occurs at or before age 65 following the completion 
of 10 or more years of Service, beginning at age 66 the SGLI 
coverage will be reduced each year in five equal decrements so 
that coverage at age 70 will be as described in the above table. 
 
If retirement occurs after age 65 following the completion of at 
least 10 but less than 20 years of Service, effective as of the 
date of retirement the SGLI coverage will be reduced to the level 
which would then have been in effect had retirement occurred at 
age 65. 
 
For a retirement occurring after age 65 with the completion of 20 
or more years of Service, the coverage in effect at retirement 
will be reduced on the first of the month following each of the 
Retiree's birthdays through age 70 in accordance with the 
following table:  
 
         Ages             Level Available 
 
          66              1.80 Times IASR 
          67              1.60   "     " 
          68              1.40   "     " 
          69              1.20   "     " 
          70 & Over       1.00   "     " 
 
A Retiree with at least 5 but fewer than 10 years of Service as of 
the date of retirement, the coverage will be reduced to $1,000 
upon retirement; for those with fewer than 5 years of Service, the 
coverage will be reduced to $500 upon retirement. 
 
Coverage will end upon retirement if it has not been maintained 
continuously since the date on which the Subscriber first became 
eligible for coverage as an Employee. 
 
4.3  Cost 
 
SGLI is noncontributory for Retirees, LTD Recipients and, in some 
cases, for eligible Employees as specified in Section 10.1. 
 
 
<PAGE>
                                                                  <PAGE> 90
4.4  Contribution Rate for Employees 
 
For Subscriber/Employees (other than those specified in Section
10.1) who are age 60 or older, and for covered Subscriber/Key 
Employees, regardless of age, the monthly cost of SGLI is 60 cents 
per $1,000 of coverage.  For other covered Employees under age 60, 
the monthly cost of SGLI is 38 cents per $1,000 of coverage. 
 
Contributions for a year are based on the Employee's IASR as of 
July 1 of the prior year.  (January 1 of the current year for 
Caribbean Employees), and age as of January 1 of the current year. 
 
4.5  IASR Used to Calculate Benefit 
 
IASR used to calculate the benefit shall be the greater of: 
 
       a)  IASR calculated as of the date of death; or 
 
       b)  the applicable of the following: 
 
           (1) IASR calculated as of the later of: (A) July 1 
               immediately prior to the start of the Plan Year in 
               which death occurs, or (B) the date the Subscriber 
               becomes eligible for the coverage. 
 
           (2) in the case of a Subscriber who is on educational 
               Leave of Absence, IASR used to calculate total 
               Company and Subscriber contributions for the 
               coverage in effect as of the day immediately 
               preceding the first day of the educational Leave of 
               Absence. 
 
           (3) in the case of a Subscriber who is a Retiree or LTD 
               Recipient, the greater of: (A) IASR as of the date 
               such person became a Retiree or LTD Recipient 
               (whichever is applicable), or (B) IASR as of July 1 
               immediately prior to the commencement of the Plan 
               Year in which such date occurs. 
 
 
5.   BENEFICIARIES 
 
5.1  Beneficiaries 
 
A Subscriber may name beneficiaries for Plan benefits.  Unless the 
Subscriber designates otherwise, beneficiaries under the applicable 
company-sponsored life insurance plan named below will also be the 
designated beneficiaries under this Plan:  Kodak Life Insurance 
Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1I.06); Family Protection Program (Benefit 
Plan 1I.01) (basic life insurance benefit); and, Kodak Group Life 
Insurance Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1I.04). 
 
The Subscriber can name one or more primary beneficiaries plus one 
or more contingent beneficiaries.  If a beneficiary dies before the 
Subscriber dies, the rights and interest of that beneficiary 
automatically terminate. 
 
All beneficiary designations must be made on proper Company forms. 
 
<PAGE>

                                                                   <PAGE> 91

5.2  Changing a Beneficiary 
 
A Subscriber can change his SGLI beneficiaries at any time without 
the consent of those beneficiaries.  All notices of beneficiary 
change must be made on proper Company forms.  When the notice of 
change is received by the Company, it will take effect on the date 
the notice was signed, whether or not the Subscriber is living at 
the time such notice is received.  If the notice is not dated, it 
will take effect as of the date received by the Company.  However, 
both the Company and the Insurance Company are discharged from 
liability if a previously named beneficiary is paid before the 
Company receives a change-of-beneficiary form. 
 
5.3  If No Beneficiary is Named 
 
       (a) Where There is No Assignment Under This Plan.  Where a 
           Subscriber has not made an assignment in accordance with 
           Section 6, if there is no beneficiary, whether because 
           there is no valid beneficiary designation in effect or 
           because no designated beneficiary is living at the time 
           of the Subscriber's death, payment of the benefit will 
           be made: 
 
           (1) To the Subscriber's surviving Spouse;  
 
           (2) If no surviving Spouse, to the Subscriber's 
               surviving children in equal shares; 
 
           (3) If no surviving child, to the Subscriber's surviving 
               parents in equal shares; and 
 
           (4) If no surviving parent, to the Subscriber's estate. 
 
       (b) Where There Is An Assignment Under This Plan.  Where a 
           Subscriber has made an assignment in accordance with 
           Section 6, if there is no beneficiary, whether because 
           there is no valid beneficiary designation in effect or 
           because no designated beneficiary is living at the time 
           of the Subscriber's death, payment of the benefit will 
           be made to the assignee. 
 
 
6.   IRREVOCABLE ASSIGNMENT 
 
The Subscriber's rights of ownership in the SGLI coverage may be 
assigned to a natural person or a trust for any purpose except as 
security for a loan.  An assignment must encompass all of the 
Subscriber's rights under the Plan with respect to the benefits 
assigned in a manner similar to assignment of an individual life 
insurance policy.  The assignment must be irrevocable.  The 
assignment will take effect when made on an approved form, properly 
completed and submitted to and approved by the Insurance Company.   
 
<PAGE>
                                                                   <PAGE> 92
An assignee shall have all the rights under the Plan with respect 
to the coverage assigned that were possessed by the Subscriber, 
including, without limitation, the right to make and change a 
beneficiary designation and the right to elect a benefit payment 
option.  Although an assignee shall not have the right to increase 
assigned coverage, in the event coverage is increased, (e.g., as a 
result of an increase in the Subscriber's IASR), that increased 
coverage will be deemed to have been assigned. 
 
 
7.   CONTRIBUTIONS 
 
7.1  First and Last Contribution 
 
Subscriber contributions required for SGLI are taken from the 
first full week of coverage through the end of the month in which 
coverage terminates or, where coverage changes from contributory 
to noncontributory, through the end of the final month of 
contributory coverage. 
 
7.2  Contribution Changes:  IASR Initiated 
 
       a)  Caribbean Employees.  For Subscribers who are Employees 
           of Kodak Caribbean, Limited, a change in IASR effective 
           on January 1 of a Plan Year will result in an immediate 
           corresponding change in required contributions for 
           Supplementary Group Life Insurance coverage.  A change 
           in IASR effective on any date after January 1 of a Plan 
           Year will result in a corresponding change in required 
           contributions for SGLI as of January 1 of the following 
           Plan Year. 
 
       b)  Non-Caribbean Employees.  For Subscribers who are 
           Employees other than Employees of Kodak Caribbean, 
           Limited, a change in IASR effective on July 1 will 
           result in a change in required contributions for 
           coverage effective January 1 of the following Plan 
           Year.  A change in IASR effective on any date after 
           July 1 of a Plan Year will result in a corresponding 
           change in required contributions for SGLI as of January 
           1 of the second following Plan Year. 
 
       c)  Change in Employment Classification.  Notwithstanding 
           the foregoing, a change in IASR of any Subscriber 
           incident to a change in employment classification from 
           part-time to full-time or from full-time to part-time 
           will result in an immediate change in the required 
           contributions for SGLI.

                                                                  <PAGE> 93

8.   CLAIMS AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS 
 
A claim must be filed on forms provided by the Insurance Company 
and be accompanied by a certified copy of a death certificate.  
Payment of Supplementary Group Life Insurance benefits shall be 
made to the beneficiary in the form of a lump-sum or such other 
form as may be made available by the Insurance Company provided 
however, that life insurance benefits under $10,000.00 shall be 
paid in lump-sum only.  Any benefits payable to a minor shall be 
paid to the legal guardian of the minor's property. 
 
 
9.   MAXIMUM BENEFITS 
 
For subscribers to the Group Life Insurance/Survivor Benefit 
Insurance Plans, the combined maximum benefit payable under the 
Group Life Insurance Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1I.04), the Survivor 
Benefit Insurance Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1I.05), and SGLI is 
$1,000,000 with SGLI being limited to $500,000.  If this combined 
maximum is reached, coverage is reduced in the following 
sequence: 
 
       a)  Survivor Benefit Insurance 
       b)  SGLI 
       c)  Group Life Insurance 
 
For subscribers to the Family Protection Program (FPP), the 
combined maximum benefit payable for FPP's basic and optional 
life insurance and SGLI is $3,000,000.  If this combined maximum 
is reached, coverage is reduced in the following sequence: 
 
       a)  FPP's optional life insurance 
       b)  SGLI 
       c)  FPP's basic life insurance 
 
 
10.   COVERAGE -- CONTINUATION, TERMINATION, CONVERSION, ON     
      RETURN TO WORK 
 
10.1  Coverage Continuation 
 
       a)  Leave of Absence.  Except in the case of an 
           educational Leave of Absence, where a Leave of Absence 
           is scheduled to last 6 months or less, the 
           Subscriber's contributions will be paid by the Company 
           and accumulated in arrears.  That arrearage will be 
           recouped when the Subscriber returns to work through 
           increased withholdings at that time.  The increase 
           will not exceed 100% of the regular Subscriber 
           contributions for the coverage.  A Subscriber who does 
           not return to the Company at the end of the Leave of 
           Absence must reimburse the Company for any outstanding 
           arrearage.  If reimbursement is not made in a timely 
           manner, the Company may exercise all the rights and 
           remedies it has as a creditor. 
<PAGE>
                                                                  <PAGE> 94

           For an educational Leave of Absence of any 
           length, and for any other Leave of Absence 
           scheduled to last more than 6 months or which 
           actually lasts beyond 6 months, the Subscriber 
           shall be required to make direct periodic 
           contributions to continue contributory coverage 
           during the Leave of Absence.  Where a Leave of 
           Absence scheduled for less than 6 months 
           extends beyond 6 months, the Subscriber shall 
           be required to commence direct periodic 
           contributions as of the earlier of (i) the date 
           the Leave of Absence is rescheduled to exceed 6 
           months, or (ii) the date the Leave of Absence 
           actually extends beyond 6 months.  The direct 
           Subscriber contributions shall be made at such 
           times and in such manner as the Plan 
           Administrator shall determine.   
 
           The amount of contributions will change if SGLI 
           contribution rates or Subscriber coverage 
           levels (age-related) change during the Leave of 
           Absence.  Also, maximum levels of coverage will 
           change on an age-related basis. 
 
           If a Subscriber who carried SGLI coverage 
           during a Leave of Absence fails to return to 
           work when the Leave of Absence expires, 
           coverage ends on the last day of the month in 
           which the Leave of Absence expires.  If, before 
           the Leave of Absence expires, the Company 
           receives notification that the Subscriber does 
           not intend to return to work, coverage ends on 
           the last day of the month in which such 
           notification is received. 
 
       b)  Layoff.  SGLI coverage continues, on a 
           noncontributory basis, for four months after 
           the end of the month of layoff, provided that 
           the Subscriber is then eligible to receive 
           benefits payable under the Termination 
           Allowance Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1T.01).  
           Coverage shall be at the level in effect as of 
           the last day of the Subscriber's employment.  
           If a Subscriber receiving SGLI coverage on a 
           noncontributory basis following a layoff 
           returns to work as a Supplementary Employee, 
           the SGLI coverage will be continued on a 
           noncontributory basis while the Subscriber is 
           working as a Supplementary Employee but only 
           for the period of time that such coverage would 
           otherwise have been paid for by the Company had 
           the Subscriber continued on layoff. If the 
           Subscriber is otherwise reemployed by the 
           Company, he shall forfeit continuation of 
           coverage under this Section.

       c)  Short-Term Disability.  Where the employment of 
           a Subscriber terminates upon the exhaustion of 
           benefits payable under the Kodak Short-Term 
           Disability Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1D.01) and the 
           Subscriber does not qualify for benefits under 
           the Kodak Long-Term Disability Plan (Benefit 
           Plan No. 1D.04), SGLI coverage continues on a 
           noncontributory basis until: (i) the last day of 
           the calendar month in which the Subscriber is 
           advised that long-term disability benefits are 
           denied, or if the Subscriber is not so advised, 
           (ii) the last day of the second calendar month 
           following the month in which employment 
           terminates.  If the Subscriber is reemployed by 
           the Company, he shall forfeit continuation of 
           coverage under this Section. 
 
       d)  Retirement or Long-Term Disability.  If a person 
           was a Subscriber immediately before becoming a 
           Retiree or an LTD Recipient, coverage continues 
           as provided in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. 
 
       e)  Termination Under Special Separation Plans.  The 
           Company may, at its option, extend coverage on a 
           noncontributory basis for eligible Employees 
           whose employment terminates under any special 
           separation plan, special early retirement plan, 
           or special early retirement supplement plan.  If 
           a Subscriber receiving SGLI coverage on a 
           noncontributory basis following termination 
           under a special separation plan returns to work 
           as a Supplementary Employee, the SGLI coverage 
           will be continued on a noncontributory basis 
           while the Subscriber is working as a 
           Supplementary Employee but only for the period 
           of time that such coverage would otherwise have 
           been paid for by the Company under the terms of 
           the special separation plan.  If the Subscriber 
           is otherwise reemployed by the Company, he shall 
           forfeit continuation of coverage under this 
           Section. 
 
       f)  Divestiture.  Where the employment of a 
           Subscriber is terminated by his or her Company 
           due to a "divestiture," as defined in the 
           Termination Allowance Plan (Benefit Plan No. 
           1T.01), as it may be amended, (or "TAP") by such 
           Company and the Subscriber is not offered a 
           "comparable position," as defined in TAP, in the 
           same geographic area by the acquirer, purchaser 
           or other transferee of the division, business, 
           function, facility, unit or group of assets sold 
           or otherwise disposed of by way of the 
           "divestiture," the SGLI coverage continues on a 
           noncontributory basis for the two (2) months 
           following the month in which employment 
           terminates. 
 
       g)  Completion of Supplementary or Special Program 
           Employment.  SGLI coverage continues, on a 
           noncontributory basis, until the end of the 
           month in which employment of a Supplementary 
           Employee or Special Program Employee terminates.  
           However, if a Subscriber other than a 
           Supplementary Employee or Special Program 
           Employee accepts a transfer to a position as a 
           Supplementary Employee or Special Program 
           Employee in lieu of layoff or termination under 
           a special separation plan, he will have SGLI 
           coverage on a noncontributory basis at the end 
           of such employment for the period of time that 
           such coverage would have been available had he 
           been laid off or terminated under a special 
           separation plan.

10.2  When Coverage Ends 
 
SGLI coverage ends at midnight on the last day of the month in 
which the earliest of the following events occurs: 
 
       a)  The Company receives request from the Subscriber to 
           discontinue SGLI coverage, or, if later, the date 
           specified in such written, signed request. 
 
       b)  Employment is terminated, except as specified in 
           Section 10.1. 
 
       c)  The date on which the group policy is discontinued. 
 
       d)  The Subscriber fails to make a required monthly 
           contribution for contributory coverages. 
 
       e)  The Employee-Subscriber who has not maintained 
           continuous coverage under SGLI becomes a Retiree. 
 
10.3  Conversion Privilege 
 
A conversion privilege is available for Supplementary Group 
Life Insurance when coverage ceases or is reduced under the 
circumstances described below. 
 
       a)  Employment is Terminated.  If employment terminates 
           for any reason, coverage may be continued under an 
           individual life insurance policy, without disability 
           or accidental death benefits.  The policy may be in 
           any form customarily issued by the Insurance 
           Company, except term insurance.  A Subscriber may, 
           however, elect a term insurance policy for a period 
           of up to one year at which time the term insurance 
           must be converted to another form customarily issued 
           by the Insurance Company. The amount of such 
           individual policy will be equal to (or at the 
           Subscriber's option, less than) the amount of his 
           coverage in effect on his employment termination 
           date. 
 
       b)  The Group Policy or Eligibility is Terminated.  If 
           the group policy is terminated, or if the Subscriber 
           is no longer a member of a classification that is 
           eligible for such coverage, then a Subscriber may 
           obtain an individual policy of life insurance from 
           the Insurance Company, subject to the same terms and 
           conditions as upon cessation of such coverage due to 
           termination of employment.  However, the amount of 
           such individual policy will not exceed the amount of 
           the coverage under the group policy on the date of 
           cessation of such coverage, reduced by any amount of 
           coverage for which he may be or may become eligible 
           under any group policy issued or reinstated by the 
           Insurance Company or any other insurer within 45 
           days after such cessation. 
<PAGE>
                                                                  <PAGE> 97 
       c)  Attainment of Certain Ages.  If the amount of 
           Subscriber's coverage is reduced, for any reason 
           upon attainment of age 65 or later, by at least 
           twenty percent (20%), the life insurance conversion 
           privilege described above will be available to him 
           on the date of the reduction.  The twenty percent 
           (20%) may be the result of one reduction or a series 
           of smaller reductions.  For any subsequent reduction 
           in the amount of his coverage which is at least 
           twenty percent (20%), the conversion privilege will 
           again be available.  The amount of any individual 
           policy issued, as a result of any reduction, will 
           not be more than the amount of the reduction.  
           However, in the event that the Subscriber does not 
           apply for that amount during the conversion period 
           described below, he will not be able to apply for 
           that amount during a later conversion period which 
           may be available to him. 
 
"Conversion periods" begin on the first day following the day 
on which coverage terminates or is reduced by at least twenty 
percent (20%) and end 31 days thereafter.  If the Subscriber 
should die during a conversion period, the amount of his 
coverage will be payable to his beneficiary whether or not he 
applied for an individual policy. 
 
If a Subscriber is not given written notice at least 15 days 
before or after the first day of the conversion period of the 
right to obtain an individual life insurance policy, he will 
have additional time in which to apply for such a policy.  If 
such notice is given more than 15 days but less than 90 days 
after the first day of the conversion period, he will then have 
45 days from the date notice is given in which to apply for an 
individual policy.  In no event may a Subscriber apply later 
than the 90th day after the first day of the conversion period. 
 
In any of the cases described above, to obtain an individual 
policy, a Subscriber must apply to the Insurance Company in 
writing and must pay the applicable premium no later than the 
last day of the conversion period.  The individual policy will 
become effective when the group coverage terminates. 
 
10.4  Coverage on Return to Work After Termination or Leave of
      Absence 
 
Continued participation in SGLI on reemployment, reinstatement 
(including return from retirement or Long-Term Disability), or 
return from leave of absence is based on the following 
provisions: 
 
       a)  If a person was covered under the Plan continuously 
           from the date of leaving to the date of return and 
           meets the requirements of Article 3 at the time of 
           returning, such coverage is continued upon return. 
 
       b)  If the person returns from a Leave of Absence which 
           qualifies as protected leave under the Family and 
           Medical Leave Act of 1993 before the protected term 
           of such leave has expired, upon return to work 
           without a termination of employment, the coverage 
           shall be restored to the level that existed at the 
           time the Leave of Absence began (subject to maximums 
           set out in Article 4). 

       c)  In all other cases, this coverage is not available 
           upon return to work.

                                                                  <PAGE> 98

10.5  Divestiture 
 
Except to the extent expressly provided in Section 10.1(f), a 
Subscriber whose employment by his or her Company is terminated 
due to a "divestiture," as defined in the Termination Allowance 
Plan (Benefit Plan No. 1I.01) by such Company is no longer 
eligible for SGLI coverage and, therefore, his or her coverage(s) 
shall end as specified in Section 10.2. 
 
 
11.   ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
Whenever a covered Employee or covered Disabled Person retires, 
insurance certificates are provided describing the provisions that 
apply specifically to him. 
 
11.1  Plan Amendment, Suspension, or Termination 
 
Eastman Kodak Company may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in 
whole or in part at any time, for any reason.  For purposes of 
ERISA Section 402(b)(3), the procedure for amending, suspending

Board or Benefit Plans Committee to such effect.  A resolution is 
considered adopted when a majority of the members of the Board or 
Benefit Plans Committee approve of the resolution by voice or 
written vote at a Board or Committee meeting, whichever is 
applicable, or if no meeting is held, the resolution is in writing 
and signed by all of the members of the Board or Benefit Plans 
Committee.

The claims and appeal procedures are described in the General 
Administration section of You and Kodak.

KODAK EXCESS RETIREMENT INCOME PLAN


ARTICLE ONE

Purpose of Plan

1.1  This Plan implements the intent of providing retirement 
benefits by means of both a funded and an unfunded 
plan.  This Plan is an excess benefit plan as defined 
in section 3(36) of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 and is designed to provide 
retirement benefits payable out of the general assets 
of the Company where benefits cannot be paid under the 
Funded Plan because of Code section 415 and the 
provisions of the Funded Plan which implement such 
section.


ARTICLE TWO

Definitions

2.1  "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended from time to time.

2.2  "Company" shall mean Eastman Kodak Company, which 
effective October 1, 1994 shall include the Nano 
Systems division, and any subsidiary and/or affiliated 
corporation which is a participating employer under the 
Funded Plan other than those covered by Appendix I of 
the Funded Plan, except where a specific reference is 
made to a particular corporation

2.3  "Effective Date" shall mean January 1, 1976.

2.4  "Employee" shall mean a participant in the Funded Plan.

2.5  "Funded Plan" shall mean the Kodak Retirement Income 
Plan.

2.6  "KRIPCO" shall mean the Kodak Retirement Income Plan 
Committee as described in the Funded Plan document.

2.7  "Plan" shall mean this Kodak Excess Retirement Income 
Plan.


ARTICLE THREE

Eligibility

3.1  All Employees eligible to receive a benefit from the 
Funded Plan shall be eligible to receive a benefit 
under this Plan if their benefits cannot be fully 
provided by the Funded Plan due to the benefit 
limitations imposed by Code section 415.
<PAGE>
                                                                 <PAGE> 102
ARTICLE FOUR

Benefits

4.1  Benefits due under this Plan shall be paid at such time 
or times following the Employee's termination of 
employment or death as the Company's Director of 
Compensation and Benefits, or his designee,or in his 
absence or personal involvement of such Director or 
designee, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources,  
may select, in his sole discretion, from among the 
options available under the Funded Plan.

4.2  The benefit payable under this Plan shall be the amount 
of the retirement income benefit to which an Employee 
would otherwise be entitled under the Funded Plan if 
the provisions of Code Section 415 as expressed in 
Article 9 of the Funded Plan were disregarded, less the 
amount of the retirement income benefit to which the
Employee is entitled under the Funded Plan.

The "retirement income benefit to which the Employee is 
entitled under the Funded Plan" generally means the 
benefits actually payable to an Employee under the 
Funded Plan; provided, however, that where the benefits 
actually payable to an Employee under the Funded Plan 
are reduced on account of a payment of all or a portion 
of an Employee's benefits to a third party on behalf of 
or with respect to an Employee (pursuant, for example, 
to a domestic relations order), the "retirement income 
benefit to which the Employee is entitled under the 
Funded Plan" shall be deemed to mean the benefit that 
would have been actually payable but for such payment 
to a third party.

4.3  If an Employee's benefit from the Funded Plan is 
subject to an actuarial reduction because of the time 
when payment commences, his benefit from this Plan 
shall also be actuarially reduced.

4.4  The benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid by 
the Company each year out of its general assets and 
shall not be otherwise funded.

4.5  If a Participant's benefit under this Plan is paid in a 
lump-sum and his benefit under the Funded Plan is paid in a 
form other than a lump-sum, the lump-sum benefit payable 
under this Plan shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the 
fact that the periodic benefit payable under the Funded Plan 
will be increased after the Annuity Starting Date to reflect 
postretirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance 
with Code section 415(d) and section 1.415(c)(2)(iii) of the 
Income Tax Regulations.

ARTICLE FIVE

Administration

5.1  This Plan shall be administered by KRIPCO in accordance 
with its terms and purposes.

5.2  KRIPCO shall have full discretionary authority to 
determine eligibility, to construe and interpret the 
terms of the Plan, including the power to remedy 
possible ambiguities, inconsistencies or omissions, or 
to determine the benefits due each Employee from this 
and the Funded Plan and shall cause them to be paid 
accordingly.

5.3  The decisions made by and the actions taken by KRIPCO 
in the administration of the Plan shall be final and 
conclusive on all persons, and the members of KRIPCO 
shall not be subject to individual liability with 
respect to this Plan.


ARTICLE SIX

Amendment and Termination

6.1  While the Company intends to maintain this Plan in 
conjunction with the Funded Plan for as long as 
necessary, the Company reserves the right to amend 
and/or terminate it at any time for whatever reasons it 
may deem advisable.

6.2  Notwithstanding the preceding Section, however, the 
Company hereby makes a contractual commitment to pay 
the benefits accrued under this Plan to the extent it 
is financially capable of meeting such obligation.


ARTICLE SEVEN

Miscellaneous

7.1  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a 
contract of employment between the Company and an 
Employee, or as a right of any Employee to be continued 
in the employment of the Company, or as a limitation of 
the right of the Company to discharge any of its 
Employees, with or without cause.

7.2  The benefits payable under this Plan are nonassignable.

7.3  This Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of

(2)  for all other covered liability exposures, you will be responsible 
     for the amount of damages up to the applicable Minimum Required
     Underlying Limit of your required primary insurance.  We will
     only pay amounts in excess of your required underlying limits and any
     other collectible insurance.
