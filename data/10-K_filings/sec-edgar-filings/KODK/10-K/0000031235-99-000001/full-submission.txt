                                 PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company or Kodak) is engaged primarily in
developing, manufacturing and marketing consumer, professional, health and
other imaging products.  Kodak's sales, earnings and identifiable assets by
operating segment for the past three years are shown in Note 18, Segment
Information.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSUMER IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the Consumer Imaging segment for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were (in
millions) $7,164, $7,681 and $7,659, respectively.

Kodak manufactures and markets various components of consumer imaging
systems.  For traditional consumer amateur photography, Kodak supplies
films, photographic papers, processing services, photofinishing equipment,
photographic chemicals, cameras (including single-use) and projectors.  The
Advanced Photo System is an amateur system of cameras, films and
photofinishing which delivers a variety of consumer features such as drop-
in loading, multiple print size options, index prints, and negatives
returned in the cartridge.  Kodak has also developed products that bridge
traditional silver halide and digital products.  These products include
kiosks and scanning systems to digitize images, digital media for storing
images, software for enhancing images and a network for transmitting
images.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's consumer imaging products and services
are distributed worldwide through a variety of channels.  Individual
products are often used in substantial quantities in more than one market.
Most sales of the Consumer Imaging segment are made through retailers.
Independent retail outlets selling Kodak amateur products total many
thousands.  In a few areas abroad, Kodak products are marketed by
independent national distributors.  In addition, certain consumer products
may be purchased through the Internet.

Kodak's advertising programs actively promote its consumer imaging products
and services in its various markets, and its principal trademarks, trade
dress and corporate symbol are widely used and recognized.

Kodak's consumer imaging products and services compete with similar
products and services of others.  Competition in traditional and digital
consumer imaging markets is strong throughout the world.  Many large and
small companies offer similar consumer products and services that compete
with Kodak's business.  Kodak's products are continually improved to meet
the changing needs and preferences of its customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the Consumer Imaging segment are
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential
materials in traditional photographic film and paper manufacturing.
Digital electronic components are becoming more prevalent in product
offerings.

                                                                   <PAGE> 3

KODAK PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT

Sales of the Kodak Professional segment for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were (in
millions) $1,840, $2,272 and $2,367, respectively.

Products of the Kodak Professional segment include films, photographic
papers, digital cameras, printers and scanners, chemicals, and services
targeted to professional customers.  These products serve professional
photofinishers, professional photographers and commercial printers and
publishers.

Kodak Polychrome Graphics, a 50/50 joint venture with Sun Chemical
Corporation, was formed on December 31, 1997.  The joint venture assumed
responsibility for the photographic plate business, as well as for the
marketing of Kodak graphic arts film, and proofing materials and equipment.
Sales for the segment decreased in 1998 primarily because the Company now
sells graphics products to the joint venture, rather than selling completed
products to final customers.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's professional imaging products and
services are distributed through a variety of channels, including the
Internet.  Most sales of the Kodak Professional segment are made to
professional photographers, printers and publishers.

Kodak's professional imaging products and services compete with similar
products and services of other small and large companies.  Strong
competition exists throughout the world in these markets.  Kodak's products
are continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its
customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the Kodak Professional segment
are many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the
essential materials used in the manufacturing of professional photographic,
industrial x-ray, and graphic arts film, and paper.  Digital electronic
components are becoming more prevalent in product offerings.

                                                                   <PAGE> 4

HEALTH IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the Health Imaging segment for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were (in
millions) $1,526, $1,532 and $1,627, respectively.

The products of the Health Imaging segment are used to capture, store,
process, print and display images and information in a variety of forms for
customers in the health care industry, for both primary and referral
diagnoses.

Products of the Health Imaging segment include medical films, chemicals,
and processing equipment, as well as services for health care
professionals.  The Health Imaging segment serves customers for general
radiology products and specialty health markets, including cardiology,
dental, mammography, oncology and ultrasound imaging.

On November 30, 1998, Kodak acquired the worldwide medical imaging business
of Imation Corp., which includes Imation's manufacturing facilities in
White City, Oregon and Oakdale, Minnesota, and all of the outstanding
shares of Imation's Cemax-Icon subsidiary in Fremont, California.  The
acquired business generates approximately $500 million in revenues
annually.
See Note 16, Acquisitions and Joint Ventures.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's health imaging products and services
are distributed through a variety of channels, primarily to health care
organizations.

Kodak's health imaging products and services compete with similar products
and services of other small and large companies.  Strong competition exists
throughout the world in these markets.  Kodak's products are continually
improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its health care
customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the Health Imaging segment are
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential
materials used in X-ray film manufacturing.

                                                                   <PAGE> 5

OTHER IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the Other Imaging segment for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were (in
millions) $2,876, $3,053 and $4,315, respectively.

Products of the Other Imaging segment include motion picture films,
audiovisual equipment, certain digital cameras and printers, copiers,
microfilm products, applications software, printers, scanners and other
business equipment, as well as supplies and service agreements to support
certain of these products.  These products serve customers primarily in
motion picture and television, office automation, and government markets.

Marketing and Competition.  Products and services of the Other Imaging
segment are distributed through a variety of channels.  The Company also
sells and leases business equipment directly to users, and has a presence
on the Internet.  The Company manufactures copiers and sells them through
its non-exclusive distributor, Danka Business Systems PLC (Danka), and
through OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) channels.  See Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
for further discussion.

These products and services compete with similar products and services of
other small and large companies.  Strong competition exists throughout the
world in these markets.  Kodak's products are continually improved to meet
the changing needs and preferences of its customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used are many and varied and generally
available.  Silver is one of the essential materials in traditional film
manufacturing.  Electronic components represent a significant portion of
the cost of the materials used in the manufacture of business equipment.

                                                                   <PAGE> 6

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Through the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in
research and development.  Research and development expenditures for 1998,
1997 and 1996 were (in millions) $922, $1,230 and $1,028, respectively.
The 1998 figure includes a $42 million charge for the write-off of in-
process research and development associated with the acquisition of Imation
Corp.'s worldwide medical imaging business on November 30, 1998.  The 1997
figure includes a $186 million charge for the write-off of in-process
research and development associated with the acquisition of Wang
Laboratories' software unit on March 17, 1997.  See Note 15, Acquisitions
and Joint Ventures.

Research and development groups are located principally in the United
States in Rochester, New York.  Outside the U.S., research and development
groups are located principally in Australia, England, France, Japan and
Germany.  These groups, in close cooperation with manufacturing units and
marketing organizations, are constantly developing new products and
applications to serve both existing and new markets.

It has been Kodak's general practice to protect its investment in research
and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents
where feasible.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's
ability to use its inventions but at the same time is accompanied by patent
licensing.  While in the aggregate Kodak's patents are considered to be of
material importance in the operation of its business, the Company does not
consider that the patents relating to any single product or process are of
material significance when judged from the standpoint of its total
business.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning
environmental matters.  Some of the U.S. federal environmental legislation
having an impact on Kodak includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act, and the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended (the Superfund law).

It is the Company's policy to carry out its business activities in a manner
consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management
practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental
laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in a program for
environmental protection and control.

Environmental protection is further discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings,
and in the Notes to Financial Statements.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMPLOYMENT

At the end of 1998, the Company employed 86,200 people, of whom 46,300 were
employed in the U.S.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   <PAGE> 7

Financial information by geographic areas for the past three years is shown
in Note 18, Segment Information.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Consumer Imaging segment of Kodak's business in the United States is
centered in Rochester, New York, where photographic goods are manufactured.
Another manufacturing facility near Windsor, Colorado, also produces
sensitized photographic goods.

Consumer imaging manufacturing facilities outside the United States are

outside of the United States.  The Company owns or leases administrative,
manufacturing, marketing and processing facilities in various parts of the
world.  The leases are for various periods and are generally renewable.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In April 1987, the Company was sued in federal district court in San
Francisco by a number of independent service organizations who alleged
violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and of various state
statutes in the sale by the Company of repair parts for its copier and
micrographics equipment (Image Technical Service, Inc. et al v. Eastman
Kodak Company, "ITS").  The complaint sought unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages.  Trial began on June 19, 1995 and concluded on September
18, 1995 with a jury verdict for plaintiffs of $23,948,300 ($71,844,900
after trebling).  The Company appealed the jury's verdict, and on August
26, 1997 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its decision affirming
in part, reversing in part, and reversing and
                                                                   <PAGE> 8

remanding on the issue of used equipment damages.  The court affirmed the
jury's liability rulings, but reduced damages (after trebling) from
$71,844,900 to $35,818,200, and narrowed the scope of the injunction under
which the Company is required to make parts available.  On April 27, 1998,
the Supreme Court denied the Company's petition for Supreme Court review,
effectively concluding all aspects of the case except plaintiffs' used
equipment claim.  The Company took a third quarter 1997 pre-tax charge of
$46,000,000.

Two cases that raise essentially the same antitrust issues as ITS are
Nationwide, et al v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed March 10, 1995, and A-1
Copy Center, et al v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed December 13, 1993.  Both
cases were filed in federal district court in San Francisco.  A-1 is a
consolidated class action.  The complaints in both cases seek unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages.  On September 16, 1998, the Company and
plaintiffs in ITS, Nationwide, and A-1 engaged in a successful mediation,
effectively concluding these cases.  Under the terms of the mediated
settlement, the Company will make payments to plaintiffs in return for
plaintiffs' discontinuance of the litigation, with prejudice.  The amount
of the Company's payments, which was covered by previously recorded
reserves, will not be material to the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

A fourth repair parts case, Broward Microfilm, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak
Company, a purported national class action which was filed February 27,
1996 in federal district court in Miami, was dismissed without prejudice on
May 13, 1998.

On July 7, 1998, the Company received a proposed administrative Consent
Order seeking unspecified penalties and a compliance schedule from the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation, to address alleged
violations of the Environmental Conservation Law and regulations at the
Company's Kodak Park manufacturing complex in Rochester, New York.  The
violations alleged are primarily comprised of air, water, and hazardous
substance releases and incidents, largely accidental, that have been
reported by the Company to the Agency over the past five years.  The
Company expects that it will be assessed a civil penalty in excess of
$100,000.  The entire matter is subject to negotiation, which can be
expected to result in an administrative settlement that will include a
penalty and a compliance schedule for implementation of maintenance,
upgrade, and reporting activities.

Information.


1998 COMPARED WITH 1997

CONSOLIDATED
- ------------

Worldwide sales for 1998 were 8% lower than in 1997, largely due to the
transfer of a portion of Kodak's graphics business to a joint venture,
Kodak Polychrome Graphics, on December 31, 1997 (see Note 15, Acquisitions
and Joint Ventures) and the reclassification of certain promotional
expenses by the Company (the "promotion reclass," see discussion in
Consumer Imaging section below).  Excluding these effects, sales decreased
5% from the prior year.  In addition, currency changes against the dollar
unfavorably affected sales by $344 million in 1998 compared with 1997.
Excluding the effects of currency rate changes and the above items, sales
decreased 2%.  A significant portion of this decrease resulted from volume
declines in emerging markets, reflecting economic conditions.
                                                                  <PAGE> 14

Overall gross profit margins improved approximately one percentage point
from 44.5% in 1997 to 45.6% in 1998, adjusting for the promotion reclass.
Excluding $165 million of charges related to the 1997 restructuring program
and $68 million of the Office Imaging charge recorded to cost of goods sold
in 1998, gross profit margins improved from 45.7% in 1997 to 46.1% in 1998.
This increase is primarily attributable to cost reductions and
manufacturing productivity which more than offset the unfavorable effects
of foreign currency rate changes, lower effective selling prices, and
volume declines in emerging markets.  Goodwill amortization increased to
$116 million in 1998 from $80 million in 1997 primarily as a result of the
Company's acquisitions in China (see Note 15, Acquisitions and Joint
Ventures).

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the Company
decreased 16% from 26.9% of sales in 1997 to 24.6% of sales in 1998.
Adjusting 1997 for the promotion reclass and excluding $64 million of the
Office Imaging charge recorded to SG&A in 1998 and the impact of the
graphics business from both years, SG&A decreased 9% from 26.0% of sales to
24.9% of sales.  This decrease is primarily attributable to the benefits
associated with the Company's cost reduction program.

Excluding the Imation charge in 1998 and the Wang charge in 1997, R&D
expenses decreased 16% from 7.2% of sales in 1997 to 6.6% of sales in 1998
as a result of improved expense management and reduced cost structure.  See
Note 15, Acquisitions and Joint Ventures, for discussion of the Imation
charge and the Wang charge and estimated costs to complete in-process R&D
projects.

Earnings from operations increased $1,758 million from the prior year.
Excluding from 1997 the $1,455 million charge for restructuring costs,
asset impairments and other charges, and the $186 million Wang charge, and
excluding from 1998 the $132 million Office Imaging charge and the $45
million Imation charge, earnings from operations for the Company increased
17%, as cost reductions and manufacturing productivity more than offset
lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of foreign
currency rate changes.

Other income (charges) increased significantly from $21 million in 1997 to
$328 million in 1998.  This increase is primarily attributable to gains on
the sales of NanoSystems and part of the Company's investment in Gretag,
gains from sales of real estate, and the divestiture of some relatively
small businesses, offset by litigation charges recorded in 1998.  Interest
expense increased 12% from the prior year, to $110 million, as a result of
higher average borrowings.

The effective tax rates were 34% in both 1998 and 1997, excluding
restructuring costs, asset impairments and other charges of $1,455 million
and the related tax benefit of $465 million from 1997.
                                                                  <PAGE> 15

From the beginning of the fourth quarter of 1997 through December 31, 1998,
approximately 11,950 employees have left the Company under the 1997 and
1996 restructuring programs (see Note 11, Restructuring Programs).  In
addition, another 800 employees left the Company under a reserve taken in
the second quarter of 1997.  In connection with the restructuring programs,
the Company reduced its operating costs by approximately $730 million in
1998.  This amount includes approximately $95 million of lower pension and
health care costs due to reduced headcount resulting from the restructuring
programs.  The 1998 savings of $730 million does not include the benefit of
divestitures or the effects of changes in exchange rates, and is net of
increased investments.  Cost reductions were achieved across all business
operations and also reflect the benefits of lower employee compensation.
Many of the remaining headcount reductions under the restructuring programs
are associated with portfolio actions and business exits which will
generate a lower rate of savings in future periods.

In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company increased its minimum target for
the cost reduction program to $1.2 billion by the end of 1999.  Savings
from this program will continue to be reflected in earnings, which not only
allows the Company to improve its results of operations, but also enhances
its competitiveness.  In addition, the Company will continue to invest in
growth opportunities in both traditional photographic and digital imaging.

In connection with the sale of the Office Imaging business on December 31,
1996, the Company and Danka entered into agreements whereby the Company
supplied high-volume copiers and printers to Danka and Danka provided the
Company with R&D funding.  Danka is the Company's primary customer for
Office Imaging products, accounting for approximately 90% of Office
Imaging's annual sales.

Financial difficulties on the part of Danka affected its ability to fulfill
the original terms of certain of its agreements with the Company in the
fourth quarter of 1998.  As a result, in December 1998, the Company's
supply agreement and certain other agreements with Danka were terminated
and interim arrangements for the supply by the Company to Danka of copier
equipment, parts and supplies were established on a month-to-month basis.
As a result of significant volume reductions by Danka, the Company was
required to take action in the fourth quarter of 1998 that resulted in
charges for employee severance (800 personnel) and write-downs of working
capital and equipment.  Such pre-tax charges amounted to $132 million and
were recorded to cost of goods sold ($68 million) and SG&A expenses ($64
million).  All actions with respect to this charge, including employee
terminations, were taken by the Company in 1998.  The Company continues to
assess its strategic options for its Office Imaging business and may need
to take further action in 1999 which could have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations.

As described in Note 15, Acquisitions and Joint Ventures, the Company
acquired Imation Corp.'s worldwide medical imaging business on November 30,
1998.  The business acquired by Kodak generates approximately $500 million
in revenues annually.  This strategic acquisition strengthens the Company's
Health Imaging segment with "dry" imaging output technology.
                                                                  <PAGE> 16

As described in Note 15, Acquisitions and Joint Ventures, the Company made
investments in two newly formed companies operating in China in 1998.
Under terms of agreements announced in 1998, the Company plans to invest
more than $1 billion in China over the next several years.  The investment
will be used to upgrade technology, improve manufacturing capacity and
expand distribution and marketing capability needed to build and support a
strong domestic Chinese imaging industry.

On April 30, 1998, the Company and Intel Corporation announced a series of
agreements that cover joint development efforts in digital imaging products
and platforms, a broad patent cross-license, upgrading of Kodak's Qualex
photofinishing laboratories with Intel architecture based scanning
equipment, and collaborative consumer-oriented marketing efforts which
could amount to $150 million (each company contributing half) over a three-
year period.

On May 19, 1998, the Company and America Online, Inc. (AOL) announced an
alliance to offer AOL members an exclusive new online service called
"You've Got Pictures!"(sm).  The service entails consumers taking pictures
with traditional cameras and film, followed by photofinishers developing
the film and then scanning and uploading pictures to AOL via Kodak PhotoNet
online.  Using an integrated feature of their AOL account, AOL members can
view their pictures, organize them into an AOL Picture Album and allow
others to access their images.

CONSUMER IMAGING
- ----------------

Consumer Imaging segment sales for the year decreased 7%.  Adjusting 1997
for the promotion reclass discussed below, segment sales for the year
decreased 5%, due to lower effective selling prices, the unfavorable
effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower unit volumes.  Sales
inside the U.S. increased 1%, as higher unit volumes were mostly offset by
lower effective selling prices.  Sales outside the U.S. decreased 9%, due
to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes, lower unit
volumes and lower effective selling prices.  Removing from both years sales
of Fox Photo, Inc., which was sold in 1998 (see Note 16, Sales of Assets
and Divestitures), worldwide segment sales decreased 4% and sales inside
the U.S. increased 3%. Excluding the effects of currency rate changes and
Fox Photo sales, worldwide segment sales decreased 1% and sales outside the
U.S. decreased 5%.

In the Consumer Imaging segment, certain U.S. promotional expenses which
are shown as sales price reductions in 1998 were shown as advertising and
promotion expenses in 1997 and 1996.  The amounts of those expenses were
$164 million in 1997 and approximately $70 million in 1996.  When comparing
1998 to 1997 and 1996, these amounts should be deducted from 1997 and 1996
sales as well as advertising expense.

Worldwide film sales decreased 7% from the prior year, adjusting 1997 for
the promotion reclass, due to lower unit volumes, the unfavorable effects
of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales
inside the U.S. decreased 5%, as slightly higher unit volumes were more
than offset by lower effective selling prices.  Sales outside the U.S.
decreased 8%, as higher effective selling prices were more than offset by
lower unit volumes and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes.
                                                                  <PAGE> 17

Worldwide color paper sales decreased 4% from the prior year, adjusting
1997 for the promotion reclass, as higher unit volumes were more than
offset by lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of
foreign currency rate changes.  Sales inside the U.S. increased 1%, as
higher unit volumes were mostly offset by lower effective selling prices.
Sales outside the U.S. decreased 7%, as modest increases in unit volumes
were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes and lower effective selling prices.

SG&A expenses for the segment decreased 9% from 28.6% of sales in 1997 to
27.4% of sales in 1998, after adjusting 1997 for the promotion reclass.
Excluding advertising expenses, SG&A expenses decreased 9% from 19.7% of
sales in 1997 to 18.9% of sales in 1998.  R&D expenses decreased 9% from
5.3% of sales in 1997 to 5.1% of sales in 1998.

Earnings from operations increased 1%, as cost reductions and manufacturing
productivity were almost entirely offset by lower effective selling prices
and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.  Net earnings
for the segment increased 8%, as a result of the gain on the sale of part
of the Company's investment in Gretag, as well as decreased losses on
foreign exchange.

KODAK PROFESSIONAL
- ------------------

Kodak Professional segment sales for the year decreased 19%.  Excluding the
impact of the graphics business from both years as a result of the joint
venture discussed above, segment sales decreased 6%.  This decrease is
primarily due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes,
lower unit volumes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales inside the
U.S. decreased 22%, or 3% excluding the impact of the graphics business
from both years, due to lower unit volumes.  Sales outside the U.S.
decreased 17%, or 8% excluding the impact of the graphics business from
both years, due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes
and lower unit volumes.

SG&A expenses for the segment decreased 41% from 27.6% of sales in 1997 to
20.3% of sales in 1998.  Excluding the impact of the graphics business from
both years, SG&A expenses decreased 12% from 27.9% of sales in 1997 to
26.2% of sales in 1998.  Excluding advertising expenses and the impact of
the graphics business from both years, SG&A expenses decreased 11% from
23.9% of sales in 1997 to 22.7% of sales in 1998. Excluding the impact of
the graphics business from both years, R&D expenses decreased 2%,
increasing slightly from 11.5% of sales in 1997 to 11.9% of sales in 1998.

Earnings from operations increased 16%, as a result of reduced segment
operating costs associated with the formation of the Kodak Polychrome
Graphics joint venture and improvements in manufacturing productivity,
offset by lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of
foreign currency rate changes.  Net earnings for the segment increased 23%,
as a result of improvements in earnings from operations, the Company's
earnings from its 50% interest in Kodak Polychrome Graphics and lower
foreign exchange losses.

                                                                  <PAGE> 18

HEALTH IMAGING
- --------------

Sales of the Health Imaging segment were essentially level with 1997.
However, excluding sales from the medical imaging business acquired from
Imation in 1998, segment sales decreased 3%, due to the unfavorable effects
of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales
inside the U.S. decreased 2%, or a decline of 5% excluding Imation, due to
lower effective selling prices and lower unit volumes.  Sales outside the
U.S. increased 1%, or a decrease of 2% excluding Imation, as higher unit
volumes were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign
currency rate changes.

Including one month of results from the medical imaging business acquired
from Imation, SG&A expenses decreased 5% from 21.7% of sales in 1997 to
20.7% of sales in 1998.  Excluding advertising expenses, SG&A expenses
decreased 4% from 20.6% of sales in 1997 to 19.7% of sales in 1998.
Excluding the 1998 Imation charge, R&D expenses decreased 13% from 8.0% of
sales in 1997 to 6.9% of sales in 1998.

Earnings from operations increased 1%, including the Imation charge.
Excluding the Imation charge, earnings from operations increased 15% as a
result of cost reductions and manufacturing productivity which more than
offset lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of
foreign currency rate changes.  Net earnings for the segment decreased 4%,
due to litigation charges.  Excluding the Imation charge, net earnings
increased 10%.

OTHER IMAGING
- -------------

Sales of the Other Imaging segment decreased 6% for the year, primarily as
a result of significant declines in Document Imaging (DI) and Commercial &
Government Systems.  Sales inside the U.S. decreased 7%, due to lower unit
volumes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales outside the U.S.
decreased 4%, due to the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes, lower unit volumes and lower effective selling prices.  In the
Office Imaging division of DI, sales fell sharply in the fourth quarter as
a result of the primary customer for Office Imaging products, Danka,
experiencing financial difficulties which resulted in significant volume
reductions.  In the Business Imaging Systems division of DI, sales declined
as a result of portfolio changes which improved earnings performance.  In
Commercial & Government Systems, sales were negatively impacted by the
completion of several large programs in 1997 for which follow-on programs
were not fully underway in 1998.

SG&A expenses increased 3% from 20.9% of sales in 1997 to 22.8% of sales in
1998.  Excluding advertising expenses, SG&A expenses increased from 18.6%
of sales in 1997 to 19.8% of sales in 1998.  Excluding the Wang charge, R&D
expenses decreased 24% from 9.9% of sales in 1997 to 8.0% of sales in 1998,
primarily due to reductions in Digital & Applied Imaging and DI.
                                                                  <PAGE> 19

Earnings from operations increased $245 million.  Excluding the Wang charge
in 1997 and the Office Imaging charge in 1998, earnings from operations
increased $191 million.  This increase is primarily attributable to the
benefits of portfolio changes in the Business Imaging Systems division and
improved performance in Digital & Applied Imaging.  Net earnings for the
segment increased $248 million as a result of improvements in earnings from
operations and gains on sales of properties.


1997 COMPARED WITH 1996

CONSOLIDATED
- ------------

Worldwide sales for 1997 were 9% lower than in 1996, largely due to the
sale of the Company's Office Imaging business in December 1996 and the
significant adverse effects of the stronger U.S. dollar.  Currency changes
against the dollar unfavorably affected sales by $558 million in 1997
compared with 1996.  Excluding the effects of currency rate changes and the
sale of Office Imaging, sales increased 3%.

Removing the impact of the Office Imaging business from both years, overall
gross profit margins as a percentage of sales decreased from 49.9% in 1996
to 45.8% in 1997.  Excluding from 1997 $165 million of charges related to
the 1997 restructuring program, gross profit margins decreased to 47.0% of
sales, as the benefits of higher unit volumes and manufacturing
productivity were more than offset by lower effective selling prices, the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and other charges
including preproduction start-up costs and inventory write-offs.  Goodwill
amortization increased to $80 million in 1997 from $66 million in 1996
primarily due to the acquisition of Wang Laboratories' software unit.

Removing the impact of the Office Imaging business from both years, SG&A
expenses for the Company decreased 2% from 27.7% of sales in 1996 to 27.5%
of sales in 1997, as the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes
more than offset increased expenditures.

R&D expenditures were $1,044 million (excluding the Wang charge of $186
million) in 1997 and $1,028 million in 1996.  Excluding the Wang charge,
R&D expenses increased 2% from 6.4% of sales in 1996 to 7.2% of sales in
1997 as a result of increased expenditures across operating segments.

Earnings from operations declined 93%.  Excluding restructuring costs,
asset impairments and other charges totaling $1,455 million in 1997 and
$358 million in 1996, earnings from operations declined 28% as the benefits
of higher unit volumes and manufacturing productivity were more than offset
by lower effective selling prices, the Wang charge and the unfavorable
effects of foreign currency rate changes.  Approximately $221 million of
the decline in earnings from operations was due to currency rate changes.

Excluding from 1996 the $387 million loss on the sale of the Office Imaging
business, other income (charges) decreased from $181 million in 1996 to $21
million in 1997, primarily due to lower interest income, the ITS charge and
higher losses on foreign exchange.
                                                                  <PAGE> 20

The effective tax rates were 34% in both 1997 and 1996, excluding
restructuring, asset impairments and other charges from both years, and the
sale of the Office Imaging business from 1996.

In 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a fourth-quarter $1.5
billion charge for restructuring related to the strategic realignment of
the Company's worldwide manufacturing, sales and marketing, R&D,
administrative, and photofinishing operations.  About half of the charge
represented separation payments for approximately 16,100 employees whose
positions would be eliminated.  The other half of the charge related to
asset write-downs and other costs associated with plans to reposition
certain non-strategic businesses.

In 1996, the Company's Board of Directors approved a fourth-quarter $358
million charge for restructuring related to severance and other termination
benefits and exit costs associated with the realignment of the Company
worldwide.  About two-thirds of the charge represented separation payments
for approximately 3,900 employees whose positions would be eliminated.  The
remainder of the charge related to asset write-downs and other costs
associated with plans to reposition certain non-strategic businesses.  See
Note 11, Restructuring Programs.

CONSUMER IMAGING
- ----------------

Consumer Imaging segment sales for the year were level, as higher unit
volumes were offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes and lower effective selling prices.  Without the effect of currency
rate changes, sales increased 4%.  Sales increased 5% in the U.S. and
decreased 3% outside the U.S.  Of the $158 million increase in the U.S.,
$117 million resulted from the inclusion of a full year's revenue in 1997
for Fox Photo, Inc., which was acquired in October 1996.

Worldwide film sales were level, as a 7% volume increase was offset by the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective
selling prices.  U.S. film sales increased 3%, with 5% volume growth
partially offset by lower effective selling prices.  Outside the U.S., film
sales decreased 2%, with 9% volume growth more than offset by the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective
selling prices.

Worldwide color paper sales decreased 4%, as 8% volume gains were more than
offset by lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of
foreign currency rate changes.  U.S. sales decreased 13%, due to a 7%
decline in unit volumes caused by consolidation of the U.S. photofinishing
industry, as well as lower effective selling prices.  Paper sales outside
the U.S. increased 2%, driven by a 17% volume increase partially offset by
lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of foreign
currency rate changes.  Sales increases reflect the impact of continuing
growth in emerging markets and new customers gained in Europe.
                                                                  <PAGE> 21

Earnings from operations decreased 19%, as higher unit volumes were more
than offset by lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects
of foreign currency rate changes.  Net earnings for the segment decreased
20%, as a result of the decrease in earnings from operations as well as
increased losses on foreign exchange.

KODAK PROFESSIONAL
- ------------------

Sales of the Kodak Professional segment decreased 4%, as higher unit
volumes were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign
currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales inside the
U.S. increased 1%, due to higher unit volumes.  Sales outside the U.S.
decreased 7%, as higher unit volumes were more than offset by the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective
selling prices.

Earnings from operations decreased 11%, primarily due to a functional
transfer of R&D expenses from certain operations in the Other Imaging
segment.  The benefits of manufacturing productivity and higher unit
volumes were offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes and lower effective selling prices.  Net earnings for the segment
decreased 14%, primarily as a result of the decrease in earnings from
operations.

HEALTH IMAGING
- --------------

Sales of the Health Imaging segment decreased 6%, as higher unit volumes
were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales inside the U.S.
decreased 4%, as higher unit volumes were more than offset by lower
effective selling prices.  Sales outside the U.S. decreased 8%, as higher
unit volumes were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign
currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.

Earnings from operations decreased 15%, as higher unit volumes and
manufacturing productivity were more than offset by lower effective selling
prices and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.  Net
earnings for the segment decreased 17%, primarily as a result of the
decrease in earnings from operations.

OTHER IMAGING
- -------------

Sales of the Other Imaging segment decreased 29%, primarily due to the sale
of the Office Imaging business.  Sales inside the U.S. decreased 31% and
sales outside the U.S. decreased 27%.  Excluding the effect of the sale of
Office Imaging, segment sales were level, as increases in Entertainment
Imaging and Digital & Applied Imaging offset decreases in other business
units.

Earnings from operations decreased $273 million, due to the Wang charge,
operational losses in the new Eastman Software business unit, and increased
losses in the Digital & Applied Imaging business unit.  Net earnings
decreased $234 million, as a result of the decrease in earnings from
operations, and the ITS charge.

                                                                  <PAGE> 22

YEAR 2000

In 1996, the Company established a formal global program office to assess
the impact of the Year 2000 issue on the software and hardware utilized in
the Company's internal operations and included in its product offerings to
customers.  The assessment addresses software applications, systems
software, information technology (IT) infrastructure, embedded
manufacturing control technology, and products and services.
Representatives of the global program office and operating divisions meet
monthly with the Chief Financial Officer to monitor program status and
address issues.  In June 1998, an independent third party completed a
comprehensive review of the Company's overall Year 2000 program.  In
October and December 1998 and February 1999, Senior Line Management
presented status reports to the Board of Directors.

The project phases include: inventorying affected technology and assessing
the impact of the Year 2000 issue; developing solution plans; modification;
testing and certification; implementation; and developing contingency
plans.  All components of software and hardware of the Company are
presently in various phases.  The Company expects to have its mission-
critical IT systems and server infrastructure tested and compliant by the
end of the first quarter of 1999, and manufacturing control systems Year
2000 compliant by mid-year 1999.  The Company also expects that actively
supported products and services, which are presently in the first five
phases, will be compliant by the end of August 1999.  The product
commercialization process has been modified so that it will produce
compliant products.

During the fourth quarter of 1998, the project team continued to increase
its global mission-critical IT compliance, used mainframe test facilities
to simulate remaining mission-critical formal applications, completed
assessment and solution plans for the Company's U.S. server network and
allocated resources to support the 1999 workplan.  The project team drove
advances in remediation of products and services, and in compliance of
operating divisions and third parties.

The Company relies on third-party suppliers for many systems, products and
services including telecommunications and data center support.  The Company
will be adversely impacted if these suppliers do not make necessary changes
to their own systems and products successfully and in a timely manner.  The
Company has a formalized comprehensive supplier compliance program in
place.  As a third-party supplier to other companies, the Company has
posted its own product compliance plan on its Internet web site
(www.kodak.com/go/year2000), which was enhanced during the third quarter of
1998 to support customer and business partner inquiries.
                                                                  <PAGE> 23

Costs of software and hardware remediation were $13 million in 1997, $27
million in 1998, and are estimated to be $12 million and $6 million in 1999
and 2000, respectively.  These remediation efforts, almost entirely for
software, will not materially increase the Company's spending on
information technology because some normal development and maintenance work
has been postponed.  Furthermore, some non-compliant systems will be
eliminated in 1999 as the Company installs Year 2000 compliant globally
deployed ERP/SAP software in connection with its enterprise resource
planning project.  A charge for the total cost of customer product
modification of $20 million was accrued in 1997.  At December 31, 1998, the
Company had a reserve of $6 million to cover remaining product
modifications.

Management of the Company believes it has an effective program in place to
resolve the Year 2000 issue in a timely manner.  However, since it is not
possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes, especially when third
parties are involved, there could be "worst-case scenarios" in which the
Company would be unable to take customer orders, manufacture and ship
products, invoice customers or collect payments.  In addition, the Company
could be subject to litigation for Year 2000-related product failure,
including equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business or
medical records, and for health, environmental and safety issues relating
to its facilities.  The amount of potential liability and lost revenue
cannot be reasonably estimated.

The Company has contingency plans for some mission-critical applications
and is working on plans for others.  For example, plans for the U.S.
payroll system have been in place since January 1998, while detailed plans
for sensitized goods manufacturing will be completed by mid-year 1999.  An
Executive Steering Committee is closely monitoring the progress of
enterprise and business process contingency plans involving, among other
actions, manual workarounds, increased inventories and extra staffing.

THE EURO

The Treaty on European Union provided that an economic and monetary union
(EMU) be established in Europe whereby a single European currency, the
euro, replaces the currencies of participating member states.  The euro was
introduced on January 1, 1999, at which time the value of participating
member state currencies was irrevocably fixed against the euro and the
European Currency Unit (ECU) was replaced at the rate of one euro to one
ECU.  For the three-year transitional period ending December 31, 2001, the
national currencies of member states will continue to circulate but be sub-
units of the euro.  New public debt will be issued in euro and existing
debt may be redominated into euro.  At the end of the transitional period,
euro banknotes and coins will be issued, and the national currencies of the
member states will cease to be legal tender no later than June 30, 2002.
The countries which adopted the euro on January 1, 1999 are Austria,
Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain.  Other countries are expected to follow
later.  The Company has operations in all of these countries.
                                                                  <PAGE> 24

As a result of the euro conversion, it is probable that selling prices of
the Company's products and services will experience downward pressure, as
current price variations among countries are reduced due to easy
comparability of euro prices across countries.  Prices will tend to
harmonize, although value added taxes and transportation costs will still
justify price differentials.  Adoption of the euro will probably accelerate
existing market and pricing trends including pan-European buying and
general price erosion.

On the other hand, currency exchange and hedging costs will be
significantly reduced; lower prices and pan-European buying will benefit
the Company in its purchasing endeavors; the number of banks and suppliers
needed will be reduced; there will be less variation in payment terms; and
it will be easier for the Company to expand into new marketing channels
such as mail order and Internet marketing.

The Company is in the process of making changes in areas such as marketing
and pricing, purchasing, contracts, payroll, taxes, cash management and
treasury operations.  Billing systems will be modified so that, in 1999,
the Company will be able to show total gross, value added tax, and net in
euros on national currency invoices, to enable customers to pay in the new
euro currency if they wish to do so.  Systems for pricing, payroll and
expense reimbursements will continue to use national currencies until year-
end 2001. The functional currencies of the Company's operations in affected
countries will remain the national currencies until approximately year-end
2000, when they will change to the euro.

The systems costs of adopting the euro are estimated to be less than $4
million since many non-euro-compliant systems will be eliminated as the
Company installs ERP/SAP software in connection with its enterprise
resource planning project.  The Company plans to be at least minimally euro-
compliant when necessary, and is preparing contingency plans to address
potential delays in systems implementation.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities in 1998 was $1,483 million.  Net
earnings, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, provided $2,243
million of operating cash. This was partially offset by decreases in
liabilities (excluding borrowings) of $516 million relating primarily to
severance payments for restructuring programs, and other changes in working
capital.  Net cash used in investing activities of $1,839 million in 1998
was utilized primarily for capital expenditures of $1,108 million and
acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $949 million.  Net cash provided by
financing activities of $77 million in 1998 was the result of net increases
in borrowings of $776 million, and employee stock options exercised of $128
million, offset by $569 million of dividend payments and $258 million of
stock repurchases.

Cash dividends per share of $1.76, $1.76 and $1.60, payable quarterly, were
declared in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Total cash dividends of
approximately $569 million, $567 million and $539 million were paid in
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
                                                                  <PAGE> 25

Net working capital (excluding short-term borrowings) increased to $939
million from $909 million at year-end 1997.  This increase is primarily
attributable to the Imation acquisition, offset somewhat by the decrease in
cash as discussed above.

The Company repurchased $258 million, $850 million and $623 million of its
shares in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, under the $2 billion
repurchase program initiated in 1996.  In 1996, the Company also
repurchased $700 million of its shares under a previous repurchase program.
Completion of the $2 billion stock repurchase program will be funded by
available cash reserves and cash from operations.  Remaining capacity under
the Company's $2 billion repurchased program at December 31, 1998 is
approximately $269 million.

Total short-term and long-term borrowings were $2,022 million at year-end
1998 and $1,196 million at year-end 1997.  The Company has access to a $3.5
billion revolving credit facility expiring in November 2001.  The Company
also has a shelf registration statement for debt securities with an
available balance of $2.2 billion.

Capital additions in 1998 and 1997 by segment are included in Note 18,
Segment Information.

See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, for environmental matters and
other commitments of the Company.

OTHER

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This Statement requires
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
and measure those instruments at fair value.  If certain conditions are
met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge.  The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  This
Statement must be adopted by the Company by the year 2000, but may be
adopted in any earlier fiscal quarter, and is not to be applied
retroactively.  If the Company had adopted SFAS No. 133 in 1998, the impact
would not have been material to its results of operations or financial
position.  The Company has not yet determined when it will adopt this
Statement.

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning
environmental matters.  See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain statements in this report may be forward-looking in nature, or
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-
K relate to the Company's Year 2000 compliance efforts, including
expectations about compliance timetables and costs.  Also, references to
the Company's $1.2 billion cost reduction initiative and to expected
savings in 1999 are forward-looking statements.

Actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in forward-
looking statements.  With respect to any forward-looking statements
contained in this report, the Company believes that its results are subject
to a number of risk factors, including: the Company's ability to implement
its product strategies (including its digitization strategy and its plans
for digital products and Advantix products), to develop its business in
emerging markets, and to assimilate acquisitions quickly; uncertainty in
the Company's Office Imaging business; the inherent unpredictability of
currency fluctuations; competitive actions, including pricing; the ability
to realize cost reductions and operating efficiencies, including the
ability to implement headcount reduction programs timely and in a manner
that does not unduly disrupt business operations, and the ability to
identify and to realize other cost reduction opportunities; the nature and
pace of technology substitution; general economic and business conditions;
the ability of the Company to identify and address successfully Year 2000
issues in a timely manner, and at costs that are reasonably in line with
projections; and the ability of the Company's vendors to identify and
address successfully their own Year 2000 issues in a timely manner.

Any forward-looking statements in this report should be evaluated in light
of these important risk factors.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financing activities,
is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices,
and interest rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and
financial position.  In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs
associated with such activities, the Company manages exposures to changes
in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
See Note 9, Financial Instruments, for further discussion of the Company's
policy for managing such exposures.

The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in
Australian, British, French, German, Irish and Spanish currencies.  The
magnitude and nature of such hedging activities are explained further in
Note 9, Financial Instruments.  If foreign currency exchange rates at
December 31, 1998 and 1997 increased 10%, the Company would incur a $92
million and $72 million loss on foreign currency forward contracts
outstanding at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  Such losses would
be substantially offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the
underlying positions hedged.
Increased foreign currency exchange rate risk from December 31, 1997 is
caused by a higher notional value of contracts to buy French francs offset
by a lower notional value of contracts to sell British pounds.

The Company has used silver option and forward contracts to minimize almost
all of its exposure to increases in silver prices in 1998 and will continue
to do so in 1999.  As of December 31, 1998, the Company had open forward
contracts hedging the majority of its planned silver requirements for 1999.
Based on broker-quoted termination values, if the price of silver decreased
10% from $5.01 and $5.99 per troy ounce at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively, the fair value of silver forward contracts would be reduced
by $25 million and $17 million, respectively.  Increased silver price risk
from December 31, 1997 is caused by a higher notional amount of silver
hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 1998.  Such losses in fair
value, if realized, would be offset by lower costs of manufacturing silver-
containing products.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its
borrowing activities and less so through investments in marketable
securities.  The Company utilizes U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper
and borrowings as well as foreign currency-denominated borrowings to fund
its working capital and investment needs.  The majority of short-term and
long-term borrowings and marketable securities are in fixed rate
instruments.  There is inherent roll-over risk for borrowings and
marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market
rates.  The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because
of the variability of future interest rates and business financing
requirements.  Using a yield to maturity analysis, if December 31, 1998
interest rates increased 10% (about 49 basis points) with the December 31,
1998 level of short-term and long-term borrowings, there would be decreases
in fair value of short-term and long-term borrowings of $1 million and $10
million, respectively.  If December 31, 1997 interest rates increased 10%
(about 51 basis points) with the December 31, 1997 level of debt and
marketable securities, there would be decreases in fair value of marketable
securities, short-term and long-term borrowings of $1 million, $3 million
and $13 million, respectively.
                                                                  <PAGE> 28
                                                                           
ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the
consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear on pages
30 through 67.  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and include certain amounts
that are based on management's best estimates and judgments.
  The Company's accounting systems include extensive internal controls
designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of its
financial records and the proper safeguarding and use of its assets.  Such
controls are based on established policies and procedures, are implemented
by trained, skilled personnel with an appropriate segregation of duties,
and are monitored through a comprehensive internal audit program.  The
Company's policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all
employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and that its
business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a manner
which is above reproach.
  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, who were responsible

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Eastman Kodak Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed
in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 71 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Eastman Kodak Company and subsidiary companies at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Eastman Kodak Company and Subsidiary Companies
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

COMPANY OPERATIONS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company or Kodak) is engaged primarily in
developing, manufacturing, and marketing consumer, professional, health and
other imaging products.  The Company's products are manufactured in a
number of countries in North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.
The Company's products are marketed and sold in many countries throughout
the world.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman Kodak
Company and its majority owned subsidiary companies.  Intercompany
transactions are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of
the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to minority interests.  The equity
method of accounting is used for investments in associated companies which
are not controlled by Kodak and in which Kodak's interest is generally
between 20% and 50%.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is
the functional currency and translation adjustments are accumulated in a
separate component of shareholders' equity.  Translation adjustments are
not tax-effected since they relate to investments which are permanent in
nature.

For subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, the U.S. dollar is the
functional currency and gains and losses that result from translation are
included in earnings.  The effect from foreign currency translation was a
gain of $6 million in 1998, a loss of $7 million in 1997 and a loss of $4
million in 1996.

The Company hedges certain foreign currency transactions and firm
commitments by entering into forward exchange contracts.  Gains and losses
associated with currency rate changes on forward contracts hedging foreign
currency transactions are recorded currently in earnings.  The effects from
foreign currency transactions, including related hedging activities, were
losses of $26 million in 1998, $66 million in 1997, and $37 million in
1996.  Gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments are deferred
and recognized in earnings or as adjustments of carrying amounts when the
transactions occur.
                                                                    <PAGE> 37

CASH EQUIVALENTS

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND NONCURRENT INVESTMENTS

At December 31, 1998, investments of $26 million included in marketable
securities were considered held to maturity.  Investments of $17 million
included in marketable securities, and $112 million of long-term marketable
securities and other investments which were included in other noncurrent
assets, were considered available for sale.

At December 31, 1997, investments of $24 million included in marketable
securities, and long-term marketable securities of $26 million which were
included in other noncurrent assets, were considered held to maturity.
Investments of $49 million included in other noncurrent assets were
considered available for sale.
                                                                                
INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of market.  The cost
of most inventories in the U.S. is determined by the "last-in, first-out"
(LIFO) method.  The cost of other inventories is determined by the "first-
in, first-out" (FIFO) or average cost method, which approximates current
cost.  The Company provides inventory reserves for excess, obsolete or slow-
moving inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology
developments or other economic factors.

PROPERTIES

Properties are recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense is provided based on historical cost and estimated
useful lives ranging from approximately five years to fifty years for
buildings and building equipment and three years to twenty years for
machinery and equipment. The Company generally uses the straight-line
method for calculating the provision for depreciation.

GOODWILL

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period
estimated to be benefited, not exceeding fifteen years.  The Company
regularly assesses all of its long-lived assets for impairment when events
or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of."  This is accomplished by comparing the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows of the asset grouping with the respective
carrying amount as of the date of assessment.  Should aggregate future cash
flows be less than the carrying value, a write-down would be required,
measured as the difference between the carrying value and the discounted
future cash flows.
                                                                    <PAGE> 38

REVENUE

Revenue is recognized from the sale of film, paper, supplies and equipment
(including sales-type leases for equipment) when the product is shipped;
from maintenance and service contracts over the contractual period, or as
the services are performed; from rentals under operating leases in the
month in which they are earned; and from financing transactions at level
rates of return over the term of the lease or receivable.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

Product development costs are charged to operations during the period
incurred.

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in "selling,
general and administrative expenses."  Advertising expenses amounted to
$756 million, $988 million and $1,026 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed
or capitalized, as appropriate, in accordance with the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 96-1,
"Environmental Remediation Liabilities."  Remediation costs that relate to
an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is
probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes.
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between
the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting
purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share is presented in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 128, "Earnings Per Share."  Basic earnings per share computations are
based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year.  Diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the
assumed exercise and conversion of employee stock options.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," which requires compensation
costs to be recognized based on the difference, if any, between the quoted
market price of the stock on the grant date and the exercise price.
                                                                    <PAGE> 39

SEGMENT REPORTING

In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," for
all periods presented.  The Company has four operating segments.  The basis
for determining the Company's operating segments is the manner in which
financial information is used by the Company in its operations.  Management
operates and organizes itself according to business units which comprise
unique products and services across geographic locations.

Environmental

Expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment for continuing
operations at various manufacturing facilities were as follows:
                                      1998      1997        1996

                                      ----      ----        ----
    Total                             $104      $115        $116
                                      ====      ====        ====

At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company's undiscounted accrued
liabilities for environmental remediation costs amounted to $91 million and
$118 million, respectively.

The Company anticpates the above expenditures to increase in the future.
However, it is not expected that these costs will have an impact which is
materially different from 1998's environmental expenditures on financial
position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position.

A Consent Decree was signed in 1994 in settlement of a civil complaint
brought by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department
of Justice under which the Company is subject to a Compliance Schedule by
which the Company improved its waste characterization procedures, upgraded
one of its incinerators, and is evaluating and upgrading its industrial
sewer system.  The total expenditures required to complete this program are
currently estimated to be approximately $43 million over the next eight
years.  These expenditures are primarily capital in nature.
                                                                    <PAGE> 43

The Company is presently designated as a potentially responsible party
(PRP) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the Superfund law), or under similar
state laws, for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of
the Company's alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at
approximately seven active Superfund sites.  With respect to each of these
sites, the Company's actual or potential allocated share of responsibility
is small.  Furthermore, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated
at these sites and, although the law imposes joint and several liability on
PRPs, as a practical matter, costs are shared with other PRPs.  Settlements
and costs paid by the Company in Superfund matters to date have not been
material.  Future costs are also not expected to be material to the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

In addition to the foregoing environmental actions, the Company is
currently implementing a Corrective Action Program required by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) at the Kodak Park site in Rochester,
NY.  As part of this Program, the Company has completed the RCRA Facility
Assessment (RFA), a broad-based environmental investigation of the site.
While future expenditures associated with any remediation activities could
be significant, the Company is currently in the process of completing a
number of RCRA Facility Investigations (RFIs) and Corrective Measures
Studies (CMS) for areas at the site.  Upon completion of these activities,
the Company expects to have fully developed estimates of the required
remediation costs.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  Expenditures to comply
with the Clean Air Act implementing regulations issued to date have not
been material and have been primarily capital in nature.  Future capital
expenditures cannot be reasonably estimated at the present time, as many of
the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to this Act have not been
issued.

The Company has retained certain obligations for environmental remediation
and Superfund matters related to the non-imaging health businesses sold in
1994.  Actions to fulfill these obligations are not expected to be
completed in the near term and costs related to the obligations are
included in remediation accruals recorded at December 31, 1998.  Included
in these obligations are responsibilities for the liabilities associated
with the non-imaging health businesses as a PRP in approximately eight
active Superfund sites.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

The Company has entered into agreements with several companies which
provide Kodak with products and services to be used in its normal
operations.  The minimum payments for these agreements are approximately
$124 million in 1999, $106 million in 2000, $80 million in 2001, $68
million in 2002, $68 million in 2003 and $115 million in 2004 and
thereafter.

The Company has also guaranteed debt and other obligations under agreements
with certain affiliated companies and customers.  At December 31, 1998,
these guarantees totaled approximately $195 million.  The Company does not
expect that these guarantees will have a material impact on the Company's
future financial position or results of operations.
                                                                    <PAGE> 44

The Company has issued letters of credit totaling $76 million to ensure the
completion of environmental remediations and payment of possible casualty
and Workers' Compensation claims.

Rental expense, net of minor sublease income, amounted to $149 million in
1998, $182 million in 1997 and $207 million in 1996.  The approximate
amounts of noncancelable lease commitments with terms of more than one
year, principally for the rental of real property, reduced by minor
sublease income, are $106 million in 1999, $81 million in 2000, $58 million
in 2001, $34 million in 2002, $23 million in 2003 and $47 million in 2004
and thereafter.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits, claims,
investigations and proceedings, including product liability, commercial,
environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being handled and
defended in the ordinary course of business.  There are no such matters
pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to be material in
relation to the Company's business, financial position or results of
operations.

Marketable securities and other investments are valued at quoted market
prices, except for $3 million and $25 million of equity investments
included in other investments at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively,
which are reflected at their carrying value because quoted market prices do
not exist.  The fair values of long-term borrowings were determined by
reference to quoted market prices or by obtaining quotes from dealers.  The
fair values for the remaining financial instruments in the above table are
based on dealer quotes and reflect the estimated amounts the Company would
pay or receive to terminate the contracts.  The carrying values of cash and
cash equivalents, receivables, short-term borrowings and payables
approximate their fair values.

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financing activities,
is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices,
and interest rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and
financial position.  In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs
associated with such activities, the Company manages exposures to changes
in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
                                                                    <PAGE> 45

Foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge certain firm
commitments and the currency risk inherent in the deposit-taking and
lending activities of the Company's International Treasury Center.  Option
and forward contracts are used to mitigate the Company's risk to
fluctuating commodity prices.  The Company's exposure to changes in
interest rates results from its investing and borrowing activities used to
meet its liquidity needs.  Long-term debt is generally used to finance long-
term investments, while short-term debt is used to meet working capital
requirements.  Derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust the
Company's interest rate risk profile.  The Company does not utilize
financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does
it utilize leveraged financial instruments.

The table below summarizes by major currency the notional amounts of
foreign currency forward contracts in U.S. dollars.  The counter-currency
for the majority of the contracts is the U.S. dollar, while some contracts
are cross-currency with one foreign currency traded for another.  Foreign
currency amounts are translated at rates current at the reporting date.
The "buy" amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to
purchase foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S.
dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies.  Substantially
all of the Company's foreign currency forward agreements will mature during
1999.  The market risk related to foreign currency forward contracts is
substantially offset by changes in the valuation and cash flows of the
underlying positions hedged.

The Company has used silver option and forward contracts to minimize almost
all of its exposure to increases in silver prices in 1998 and will continue
to do so in 1999. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had open forward
contracts hedging the majority of its planned silver requirements for 1999.
Silver forwards outstanding at December 31, 1998 have notional amounts of
$241 million.  All silver hedging contracts are settled in cash.  Gains and
losses related to silver hedges are recorded as adjustments to the carrying
amount of silver inventory when purchased, and recognized in results of
operations as silver-containing products are sold.  The market risk related
to silver options and forward contracts is substantially offset by changes
in the cost of silver purchased.

The Company's financial instrument counterparties are high quality
investment or commercial banks with significant experience with such
instruments.  The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk
through specific minimum
credit standards and diversification of counterparties.  The Company has
procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts.  The maximum credit
exposure at December 31, 1998 was not significant to the Company.

carryforwards are subject to a five-year expiration period.

Retained earnings of subsidiary companies outside the U.S. were
approximately $1,036 million and $792 million at December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively.  Retained earnings at December 31, 1998 are considered
to be reinvested indefinitely.  If remitted, they would be substantially
free of additional tax.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred
tax liability for temporary differences related to these retained earnings.

NOTE 11:  RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS

1997 Program

In December 1997, the Company committed to implement a restructuring
program and recorded a pre-tax provision of $1,455 million for severance
and other termination benefits and exit costs related to the strategic
realignment of the Company's worldwide manufacturing, sales and marketing,
R&D, administrative, and photofinishing operations.  The Company recorded
$165 million of the $1,455 million provision as cost of goods sold,
primarily for inventory write-downs and other costs.  The remaining $1,290
million included $862 million of restructuring costs and $428 million of
asset impairments.

Severance costs for 16,100 personnel included in the restructuring
provision resulted from business exits and capacity reductions associated
with the realignment of manufacturing (7,950 personnel), and service and
photofinishing operations (2,675 personnel); and the consolidation of sales
and marketing (1,425 personnel), R&D (1,000 personnel) and administrative
(3,050 personnel) functions in various locations of the Company's worldwide
operations.  Approximately 9,650 personnel had been terminated under this
program by the end of 1998.  The remaining terminations are expected to be
completed by December 31, 1999 and are primarily associated with portfolio
actions and business exits.

As a result of capacity reductions and portfolio actions to exit
nonstrategic businesses, provisions were recorded to write down assets and
provide for costs associated with the shutdown of certain facilities and
operations.  Activities relating to these actions affected numerous
business lines and functional areas around the world.  Primary actions
involved the reorganization of sensitized goods manufacturing and research
labs operations as well as decisions to exit numerous businesses across all
operating segments, with a significant portion relating to Consumer Imaging
and Other Imaging segment businesses.

As a result of these actions, amounts were recorded relating to severance
and termination benefits for employees, costs associated with the
demolition or shutdown of facilities as a result of the Company's exit
activities and lease cancellation and penalty costs for existing
obligations relating to leased facilities.  In addition, impairment charges
were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of," and inventories were written down to net realizable value as a result
of the Company's decision to realign its operating facilities and in
connection with the exit of non-strategic businesses.  The Company also
recorded reserves for future estimated losses on existing contractual
customer obligations associated with certain businesses being exited,
categorized as other costs in the table below.

As of December 31, 1997, the Company had a liability of $368 million
remaining for this program, primarily for severance payments.  The Company
completed the majority of the actions under this program in 1998, and
expects to complete the remaining actions in 1999.  The Company believes
the amounts accrued under the 1997 and 1996 programs are adequate to cover
remaining actions under such programs.
                                                                    <PAGE> 49

1996 Program

The Company recorded a pre-tax provision of $358 million in 1996 for
severance and other termination benefits for approximately 3,900 personnel
and exit costs related to the realignment of the Company worldwide.  The
$358 million provision included $299 million of restructuring costs
primarily for severance and termination benefits.  In addition, shutdown
costs and lease penalty and cancellation costs of $59 million included in
the $299 million charge were accrued in connection with the elimination and
consolidation of facilities and infrastructure.  In adddition to this, a
$59 million charge related to asset impairments was recorded as a result of
the Company's restructuring actions.

The principal purpose of this program is to eliminate infrastructure and
operational inefficiencies and redundancies throughout the Company by
taking actions to separate personnel, close facilities and exit non-
strategic businesses.  A portion of the program includes the restructuring
of retail and wholesale photofinishing operations, primarily outside the
U.S.  Additionally, the plan addressed certain infrastructure activities
which supported the Office Imaging business, which was sold to Danka in
1996.  Of the 3,900 employees to be terminated, approximately 2,400 relate
to administrative and marketing functions, 1,300 are attributed to
photofinishing operations and 200 in manufacturing operations.

As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had a liability of $46
million and $225 million, respectively, remaining for this program,
primarily for severance payments, most of which will be paid in 1999.
Substantially all employees to be terminated under this program have been
terminated by the end of 1998.

NOTE 12:  RETIREMENT PLANS

Substantially all U.S. employees are covered by a noncontributory plan, the
Kodak Retirement Income Plan (KRIP), which is funded by Company
contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.  The funding policy for KRIP is
to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as
determined by employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts the
Company determines to be appropriate.  Generally, benefits are based on a
formula recognizing length of service and final average earnings.  Assets
in the fund are held for the sole benefit of participating employees and
retirees.  The assets of the trust fund are comprised of corporate equity
and debt securities, U.S. government securities, partnership and joint
venture investments, interests in pooled funds, and various types of
interest rate and foreign currency financial instruments.  Kodak common
stock represents approximately 8.0% of trust assets.

The benefit obligation of KRIP excludes amounts for all employees (both
retired and active) of the non-imaging health businesses sold in 1994 since
those obligations were transferred to the buyers of such businesses. The
transfer of assets from the KRIP trust fund to the buyers of the non-
imaging health businesses was not completed as of December 31, 1998.  The
Company retained the obligation for employees of the Office Imaging
business as a result of the sale of this business in 1996.

Most subsidiaries and branches operating outside the U.S. have retirement
plans covering substantially all employees.  Contributions by the Company
for these plans are typically deposited under government or other fiduciary-
type arrangements.  Retirement benefits are generally based on contractual
agreements that provide for benefit formulas using years of service and/or
compensation prior to retirement.  The actuarial assumptions used for these
plans reflect the diverse economic environments within the various
countries in which the Company operates.

The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 132, "Employers'
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits," in 1998.
                                                                    <PAGE> 51
                                                                                
Changes in the Company's benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status
for major plans are as follows:

The Company recorded an $8 million curtailment loss and a $2 million
settlement charge in 1998 as a result of the reduction in employees in 1998
from the 1997 restructuring program.  The Company recorded an $11 million
curtailment loss and a $1 million settlement credit in 1996 as a result of
the sale of the Office Imaging business, which was included in the loss on
the sale.

The weighted assumptions used to compute pension amounts for major plans
were as follows:

The Company also sponsors an unfunded plan for certain U.S. employees,
primarily executives.  The benefits of this plan are obtained by applying
KRIP provisions to all compensation, including amounts being deferred, and
without regard to the legislated qualified plan maximums, reduced by
benefits under KRIP.  At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the projected benefit
obligations of this plan amounted to $232 million and $222 million,
respectively.  The Company had recorded long-term liabilities at those
dates of $208 million and $195 million, respectively.  Pension expense
recorded in 1998, 1997 and 1996 related to this plan was $26 million, $25
million and $24 million, respectively.

NOTE 13:  NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company provides health care, dental and life insurance benefits to
U.S. eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees.  In general,
these benefits are provided to U.S. retirees that are covered by the
Company's principal pension plan (KRIP).  These benefits are funded from
the general assets of the Company as they are incurred.  Certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries offer health care benefits; however, the cost of such benefits
is insignificant to the Company.

The Company recorded a $103 million curtailment gain in 1998 as a result of
the reduction in employees in 1998 from the 1997 restructuring program.
The Company recorded a $97 million curtailment gain in 1996 as a result of
the sale of the Office Imaging business, which was included in the loss on
the sale.

In 1998, the Company moved to a new managed-care base health plan in order
to effectively manage health care costs while maintaining the quality of
care.  This change resulted in a reduction of $25 million for 1998
postretirement benefit costs.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care plans.  A one percentage point change
in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

NOTE 14:  STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company's stock incentive plans consist of the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term
Compensation Plan (the 1995 Plan), the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation
Plan (the 1990 Plan) and the 1985 Stock Option Plan (the 1985 Plan).  The
Plans are administered by the Executive Compensation and Development
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Under the 1995 Plan, 22 million shares of the Company's common stock may be
granted to a variety of employees between February 1, 1995 and December 31,
1999.  Option prices are not less than 100% of the per share fair market
value on the date of grant, and the options generally expire ten years from
the dates of grant, but may expire sooner if the optionee's employment
terminates.  The 1995 Plan also provides for Stock Appreciation Rights
(SARs) to be granted, either in tandem with options or freestanding.  SARs
allow optionees to receive payment equal to the difference between the
Company's stock market price on grant date and exercise date.  At December
31, 1998, 221,544 freestanding SARs were outstanding at option prices
ranging from $56.31 to $71.81.

Under the 1990 Plan, 22 million shares of the Company's common stock were
eligible for grant to key employees between February 1, 1990 and January
31, 1995.  Option prices could not be less than 50% of the per share fair
market value on the date of grant; however, no options below fair market
value were granted.  The options generally expire ten years from the dates
of grant, but may expire sooner if the optionee's employment terminates.
The 1990 Plan also provided that options with dividend equivalents, tandem
SARs and freestanding SARs could be granted.  At December 31, 1998, 65,242
tandem SARs and 131,725 freestanding SARs were outstanding at option prices
ranging from $31.45 to $44.50.

Under the 1985 Plan, 408,039 options, 21,037 tandem SARs and 7,076
freestanding SARs were outstanding at December 31, 1998, at the option
price of $33.79.  The 1985 Plan terms are similar to the 1995 Plan terms.

In April 1998, the Company made a one-time grant of 100 stock options for
common stock to all employees of the Company at that date (8,468,100 shares
under options).  The options were granted at fair market value on the date
of grant and expire ten years from the grant date.  The options have a two-
year vesting period.  The Executive Compensation and Development Committee
of the Board of Directors approved the one-time grant.
                                                                    <PAGE> 56

Pro forma net earnings and earnings per share information, as required by
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options under
SFAS No. 123's fair value method.  The fair value of these options was
estimated at grant date
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-
average assumptions:

                                          1998           1997          1996

NOTE 15:  ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES

1998

On March 12, 1998, the Company acquired 51% of PictureVision Inc.'s stock
for approximately $50 million.  PictureVision, the leading provider of
digital imaging network services and solutions at retail, operates as a
subsidiary of the Company.  Kodak has integrated the products and
activities of its Picture Network, which provides consumers with an
Internet-based digital imaging network service, with PictureVision's
digital imaging service, PhotoNet.  The acquisition has been accounted for
as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating results of the business have
been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from
the date of acquisition.

In February 1998, the Company contributed $308 million to Kodak (China)
Company Limited (KCCL), a newly formed company operating in China, in
exchange for 80% of the outstanding shares of the company.  On March 25 and
September 1, 1998, the new company acquired certain manufacturing assets of
Shantou Era Photo Material Industry Corporation, a Chinese domestic
photographic enterprise, for $159 million in cash and $22 million in debt
payable in 2003.  On March 26, 1998, KCCL acquired certain manufacturing
assets of Xiamen Fuda Photographic Materials Company, Ltd., another Chinese
domestic photographic enterprise, for $149 million.

In February 1998, the Company contributed $32 million to Kodak (Wuxi)
Company Limited (KWCL), a newly formed company operating in China, in
exchange for 70% of the outstanding shares of the business.  On April 2,
1998, KWCL acquired part of the manufacturing assets of Wuxi Aermei Film
and Chemical Corporation, a Chinese domestic photographic enterprise, for
$11 million in cash and $21 million in debt payable in 1999.

The acquisitions by KCCL and KWCL have been accounted for as purchases and,
accordingly, the operating results of the acquired companies have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the
dates of acquisition.  Substantial portions of the purchase prices were
allocated to goodwill, which is being amortized over a ten-year period.
                                                                                
On November 30, 1998, Kodak acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Imation's medical imaging business, including all of the
outstanding shares of Imation's Cemax-Icon subsidiary, for approximately
$530 million.  The business acquired by Kodak generates approximately $500
million in revenues annually.  The transaction was accounted for by the
purchase method and, accordingly, the operating results of the business
have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
from the date of acquisition.  A subtantial portion of the purchase price
was allocated to tangible assets and goodwill, which is being amortized
over a ten-year period.  See discussion regarding in-process R&D charges
below.

                                                                    <PAGE> 59

Upon closing of the Imation acquisition, the civil litigation concerning
certain intellectual property disputes between the companies in the United
States and Italy was settled.  At the same time, the related civil
litigation between Kodak and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. was also
settled.

The 1998 and 1997 acquisitions did not have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations in those years.  Pro forma financial
information has not been presented since the acquisitions, both
individually and in the aggregate within the respective years, would not
have had a material impact on the Company's financial position or results
of operations.

1997

On March 17, 1997, the Company acquired the assets and liabilities of the
Wang Laboratories' software business unit for approximately $260 million in
cash.  The unit is engaged in the development of workflow, imaging,
document management and network storage management and desktop software.
The transaction was accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly,
the operating results of the business have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of
acquisition.  Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition is being
amortized over five years.  See discussion regarding in-process R&D charges
below.

On September 2, 1997, the Company completed a program to increase its stake
in Chinon Industries, Inc. from 12% to 50.1%.  The Company's consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Chinon beginning September 2.
Kodak and Chinon closely collaborate on the development and production of
digital cameras; Chinon also produces Kodak's IL-500 scanner.  Kodak and
Chinon will continue to collaborate on engineering and development of
digital cameras and scanners.

On October 2, 1997, the Company purchased CPI's interest in the Fox Photo,
Inc. joint venture for $10 million in cash and a $43.9 million note.  The
two companies formed the venture in October 1996.  The transaction was
accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, the operating
results of the venture have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements from the date of formation.  On September 1, 1998, the
Company sold all of its shares of Fox Photo, Inc. as discussed in Note 16,
Sales of Assets and Divestitures.

On December 31, 1997, the Company and Sun Chemical Corporation formed a
joint venture, Kodak Polychrome Graphics, that supplies film, paper,
conventional and computer-to-plate solutions, processing chemistry and
digital color proofing products to the global graphics arts market.  Each
company owns 50% of the venture and shares profits equally.  Assets
contributed to the joint venture were reclassified to other noncurrent
assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  The Company's
investment in the venture is accounted for using the equity method.
                                                                    <PAGE> 60

In-process Research and Development Charges

In connection with recent business combinations, the Company allocated a
portion of the purchase price to acquired in-process R&D totaling $42
million in the fourth quarter of 1998 related to the Imation acquisition
and $186 million in the first quarter of 1997 related to the Wang
acquisition.

The Company used independent professional appraisal consultants to assess
and allocate values to the in-process R&D.  These allocations represent the
estimated fair value based on risk-adjusted future cash flows related to
the incomplete projects.  At the dates of the respective business
combinations, the development of these projects had not yet reached
technological feasibility and the R&D in progress had no alternative future
uses.  Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the respective
acquisition dates.

The valuations were determined by the Company using the income approach.
The Company believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were
reasonable at the time of the respective business combinations.  No
assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used to
estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the
events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated.  For
these reasons, actual results may vary from the projected results.

Management expects to continue supporting the viable remaining R&D programs
and believes the Company has a reasonable chance of successfully completing
the remaining R&D programs.  However, there is a risk associated with the
completion of the R&D projects and the Company cannot be assured that any
will meet with either technological or commercial success.

Without successful completion of the remaining R&D efforts on the acquired
in-process technologies, the end result would be to fail to fulfill product
design specifications and in turn fail to meet market requirements.  As a
result, the Company would not realize the future revenues and profits
attributed to the acquired R&D.  Ultimately, the Company would fail to
realize the expected return on such investments.  The failure of any
particular individual in-process R&D project would not materially impact
the Company's financial position or results of operations.  Operating
results are subject to uncertain market events and risks, which are beyond
the Company's control, such as trends in technology, market size and
growth, and product introduction or other actions by competitors.

A description of the acquired in-process technology and the estimates of
the fair value of in-process R&D made by the Company for each business
combination are set forth below.
                                                                    <PAGE> 61

Imation Medical Imaging

The in-process technology acquired from Imation consists of eight R&D
projects within three broad technology groupings:  Dry, Imagesetting and
Analog, which comprise $31 million, $10 million and $1 million,
respectively.  The specific nature of the significant technology acquired
from Imation, dry technology, is outlined below.

Unlike wet technology used in medical imaging applications, dry
technologies require no wet chemistry, wet film processing or darkroom
procedures.  The dry technology projects include next-generation laser
printing systems for high resolution mammography applications, low cost
decentralized printing networks with dedicated modality connections and a
flexible image acquisition unit with three direct inputs, network input and
output.  Dry technology projects also include next-generation dry media
with improved image stability and lower unit cost.

Estimated net cash inflows from the acquired in-process technology related
to Medical Imaging are projected to commence in the year 2000, peak in 2001
and steadily decline through 2007.  The in-process technology is expected
to be completed by the year 2000.

As of the date of acquisition, $44 million had been expended to develop
these R&D projects.  The estimated cost to complete the projects is
approximately $11 million, to be incurred through the year 2000.  Remaining
efforts on the projects are significant and include most phases of project
design, development and testing.

The fair value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined
by estimating the contribution of the purchased in-process technology to
developing commercially viable products and estimating the resulting cash
flows from the expected product sales of such products.   The resulting
cash flows were discounted to their present value using a rate of 12%.
Cash flows attributable to development efforts, including the completion of
developments underway, and future versions of the product that have not yet
been undertaken, were excluded in the valuation of in-process R&D.  A
contributory asset charge was applied for the use of working capital, fixed
assets, developed technology and other intangibles.  There were no material
anticipated changes from historical pricing, margins and expense trends.

Acquired developed technology of approximately $90 million was capitalized
at acquisition date and is being amortized over seven years on a straight-
line basis.
                                                                    <PAGE> 62

Wang Software

In-process technology acquired from Wang was comprised of several new and
next-generation technology projects, which included the creation of
significant Desktop/Workgroup Imaging Systems and Production Imaging
Systems, as well as Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD), Document
Warehouse, and New Imaging and Workflow technologies.  The fair value
assigned to the Desktop/Workgroup Imaging Systems and Production Imaging
Systems was approximately $6 million and $21 million, respectively, while
the fair value assigned to COLD, Document Warehouse, and New Imaging and
Workflow technologies was approximately $17 million, $30 million and $102
million, respectively,  The Company also assessed other in-process
technologies, including Storage Management and Document Management
technologies, to which it assigned a fair market value of approximately $10
million.

Unlike proven existing software technology, the above in-process next-
generation technology is considered unproven and start-up in nature in the
industry.  As of the date of acquisition, an estimated $30 million had been
expended to develop these R&D projects.  The estimated completion costs to
be incurred through the year 1999 were approximately $50 million.
Remaining efforts on the projects are significant and include most phases
of project design, development and testing.

The fair value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined
by estimating the contribution of the purchased in-process technology to
developing commercially viable products and estimating the resulting cash
flows from the expected product sales of such products. The resulting cash
flows were discounted to their present value using rates of 17% to 19%.
Contributory asset charges were applied for the use of working capital,
fixed assets, developed technology and other intangibles.  There were no
material anticipated changes from historical pricing, margins and expense
trends.

Acquired developed technology of approximately $25 million was capitalized
at acquisition date and is being amortized over five years on a straight-
line basis.

The in-process R&D projects acquired from Wang are six to twelve months
behind the original completion schedule.  Additionally, the Document
Warehouse project has been discontinued as a result of strategic changes in
the Company's portfolio.

NOTE 16: SALES OF ASSETS AND DIVESTITURES

In June 1998, the Company sold part of its investment in Gretag Imaging
Group, a Swiss manufacturer of film processing equipment.  The proceeds
from the sale were $72 million and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $66
million in other income(charges).

On September 1, 1998, the Company sold all of its shares of Fox Photo, Inc.
to Wolf Camera for an amount approximating the current value of Fox Photo's
net assets.

On October 1, 1998, Elan Corporation, plc purchased from Kodak all the
assets and liabilities of Kodak's subsidiary NanoSystems L.L.C., a drug
delivery company, for approximately $150 million in a combination of $137
million cash and warrants to purchase ordinary shares in Elan.  The Company
recorded a pre-tax gain of $87 million in other income (charges) on the
sale in the fourth quarter of 1998.

In connection with the sale of the Office Imaging business on December 31,
1996, Kodak and Danka entered into agreements whereby Kodak supplied high-
volume copiers and printers to Danka and Danka provided Kodak with R&D
funding.  Danka paid Kodak $559 million in cash, net of final adjustments,
in exchange for certain assets and the assumption of certain operating
liabilities.  The book value of net assets sold was $716 million.  The
Company recorded liabilities for employee separation payments, contract
termination payments, and transaction and other costs.  As a result of this
transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $387 million in other
income (charges).

Financial difficulties on the part of Danka affected its ability to fulfill
the original terms of certain of its agreements with the Company in the
fourth quarter of 1998.  As a result, in December 1998, the Company's
supply agreement and certain other agreements with Danka were terminated
and interim arrangements for the supply by the Company to Danka of copier
equipment, parts and supplies were established on a month-to-month basis.
As a result of significant volume reductions by Danka, the Company was
required to take action in the fourth quarter of 1998 that resulted in
charges for employee severance (800 personnel) and write-downs of working
capital and equipment.  Such pre-tax charges amounted to $132 million and
were recorded to cost of goods sold ($68 million) and SG&A expenses ($64
million).  All actions with respect to this charge, including employee
terminations, were taken by the Company in 1998.  The Company continues to
assess its strategic options for its Office Imaging business and may need
to take further action in 1999 which could have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations.

NOTE 17:  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 1994, the Company sold the pharmaceutical and consumer health businesses
of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and do-it-yourself
products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics Division.
In computing the net gain from discontinued operations, the Company
recorded amounts for environmental exposures, product liabilities, buyer
indemnifications, purchase price adjustments, taxes and other items based
on the best estimates available at the time the transactions occurred.  In
1996, the Company completed negotiations with buyers and filed tax returns
associated with the sale of the non-imaging health businesses.  As a result
of these actions and a further assessment of the liabilities recorded at
the time of the sale, the Company recognized a $277 million after-tax
benefit in discontinued operations in 1996, the primary component of which
was income and other taxes.

be at all times bona fide shareholders of the corporation.  The directors

annual meeting of the shareholders held after 1987, the directors chosen to
succeed those whose terms have then expired shall be identified as being of
the same class as the directors they succeed and shall be elected by the
shareholders for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of
the shareholders.

Section 3.  Vacancies.

     In the event of a vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, the
remaining directors, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, expressed
at a duly called meeting of the directors, may fill such vacancy until the
next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders including one resulting from
an increase in the number of directors as provided in Section 5 of the
Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 4.  Compensation.

     Directors may receive from the corporation such reasonable

Section 6.  Notice of Regular Meetings of Directors.

     No notice shall be required to be given of any regular meeting of the
Board of Directors except as the Board may require.

time, place, and purpose or purposes thereof, shall be given by the
Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary or any two members of
the Board to each member of the Board not less than two (2) days by mail or
one (1) day by telegraph or telephone prior to the date specified for such
meeting.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors may also be held at
any place and time, without notice, by unanimous consent of all the members
or provided all the members are present at such meeting.

Section 9.  Quorum.

     At any meeting of the Board of Directors a quorum shall consist of one-
third of the total number thereof and, except as otherwise provided by law
or these by-laws, a majority of such quorum shall decide any question that
may come before the meeting.  A majority of the members present at any
regular or special meeting, although less than a quorum, may adjourn the
same from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum is present.  At such adjourned meeting at which a
quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted at the meeting as originally called.

Section 10.  Action of Directors or Committees Without a Meeting or When
Members are in Separate Places.

     Any action required or permitted to be taken pursuant to authorization
voted at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board
may be taken without a meeting if, prior or subsequent to such action, all
members of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent
thereto in writing and such written consents are filed with the minutes of
the proceedings of the Board or committee.
     Any or all directors may participate in a meeting of the Board or in a
meeting of a committee of the Board by means of a conference telephone or
any means of communication by which all persons participating in the
meeting are able to hear each other as though he or they were present in
person at such meeting.
                                                                    <PAGE> 85

Section 11.  Common Directorship and Directors' Personal Interest.

     No contract or other transaction between the corporation and one or
more of its directors, or between the corporation and any other
corporation, firm or association of any type or kind in which one or more
of this corporation's directors are directors or are otherwise interested,
shall be void or voidable solely by reason of such common directorship or
interest, or solely because such director or directors are present at the
meeting of the Board or a committee thereof which authorizes or approves
the contract or transaction, or solely because his or their votes are
counted for such purpose, (1) if the contract or other transaction is fair
and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it is authorized, approved
or ratified; (2) or the fact of the common directorship or interest is
disclosed or known to the Board or committee and the Board or committee
authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract or transaction by a vote
sufficient for the purpose without counting the vote or votes of such
common or interested director or directors; (3) or the fact of the common

     Certificates of stock shall be issued only in numerical order.  They

Treasurer, Assistant Secretary or Assistant Treasurer.  They shall also be

respectively.

fact and the Transfer Agent or the corporation registers a transfer of the
shares before receiving such a notification, the owner shall be precluded
from asserting against the corporation any claim for registering the
transfer of such shares or any claim to a new certificate.

     Subject to the foregoing, where the owner of shares claims that the
certificate representing such shares has been lost, destroyed, or
wrongfully taken, the corporation shall issue a new certificate in place of
the original certificate if the registered owner thereof, or his legal
representative, (a) requests the issue of a new certificate before the
corporation has notice that the certificate has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser; (b) makes proof in such form as the corporation may
prescribe of his ownership of the shares represented by the certificate and
that the certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken; (c)
files either (i) an assumption of liability by a surety approved by the
corporation under a blanket lost instrument indemnity bond, substantially
in the form approved by the corporation, or (ii) an indemnity bond in such
form and with such surety and in such amount (open or specified) as may be
approved by the corporation, indemnifying the corporation and its transfer
agents and registrars against all loss, cost and damage which may arise
from issuance of a new certificate in place of the original certificate;
and (d) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the
corporation.  Approvals or any requirements pursuant to this section by the
corporation may be granted or imposed by the President, and Vice-President,
the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, or any other officer as authorized
by the Board of Directors.

                                                                    <PAGE> 92

purpose, none of whom shall be parties to the proceedings, or if there are
not at least three directors who are not parties to the proceedings, or if

January 28, 1999


T0:  Richard T. Bourns

RE:  Retirement

Dear Dick:

Once signed by both parties, this letter shall constitute an agreement
between Eastman Kodak Company ("Kodak") and you.  Its purpose is to
confirm the terms of your retirement from Kodak.

1.   Retirement Date

It is hereby agreed that you will voluntarily terminate your employment
on January 31, 1999 (the "Termination Date").  It is further agreed that
you will retire from Kodak on February 1, 1999.

2.   Responsibilities

During the remainder of your employment by Kodak, you will perform the
duties and responsibilities assigned to you by the Chief Operating
Office.

3.   Stock Options

Subject to your satisfaction of the terms of this letter agreement, your
termination of employment will be treated as an "Approved Reason" and a
"Permitted Reason" for purposes of any nonqualified stock options to
acquire Eastman Kodak Company common stock held by you at the time of
your termination of employment.  Consequently, you will not forfeit any
Kodak stock options by virtue of your termination of employment.  Rather,
unless sooner forfeited, they will vest per their terms and expire on
their scheduled expiration date.

4.   Alarm System

Subject to your satisfaction of the terms of this letter agreement, you
will be permitted to retain the alarm system that is presently installed
in your residence at 575 Colby Road, Spencerport, NY.  After your
retirement, you will, however, be solely responsible for paying any
service related fees associated with the alarm system.
                                                                <PAGE> 95

5.   Performance Stock Program

Upon your termination of employment, the awards you have earned and
deferred under the Performance Stock Program (the "Program"), i.e., the
awards for the 1993-1995 Restricted Stock Subplan to the Eastman Kodak
Company 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan and the 1995-1996
Performance Cycle of the Performance Stock Program under the Eastman
Kodak Company 1995 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan (the "1995 Omnibus
Plan"), will be paid to you pursuant to the terms of such program.  That
is, payment will be made in a single sum or in annual installments at the
discretion of the Committee.

Recognizing that your termination of employment will be for "Retirement"
under the terms of the Program, you will remain eligible for awards under
the Program's 1996-1998, 1997-1999 and 1998-2000 Performance Cycles,
provided awards are paid for such cycles.  Any award earned for these
three cycles will be paid in the form of shares of Kodak common stock,
not subject to any restrictions.  The awards you earn for the 1997-1999
and 1998-2000 Performance Cycles will be pro-rated based upon your length
of service during such cycles.

Please keep in mind that under the terms of 1995 Omnibus Plan, all awards
are, until paid, subject to forfeiture under Section 14.3 entitled
"Noncompetition."

6.   Wage Dividend

You will be eligible for any Wage Dividend payable for the 1998
Performance Period based upon your participating compensation for this
period.  This award will be paid, subject to withholding for all
applicable income and payroll taxes, in cash at the same time the plan's
other participants receive their award for the 1998 Performance Period.

7.   Management Variable Compensation Plan.

You will remain eligible for an award under the Management Variable
Compensation Plan for the 1998 Performance Period.  If awards are paid
for such period, whether your receive an award, and if so the size of
such award, will be based upon your achievement of your performance
commitments for 1998.  Any award earned by you will be paid, subject to
withholding for all applicable income and payroll taxes, at the same time
the plan's participants receive their awards for the 1998 Performance
Period.

8.   Financial Counseling

You will, at Kodak's expense, continue to be eligible to participate in
Kodak's financial counseling program for the two-year period commencing
upon the Termination Date.  The payment of these expenses on your behalf
will be treated as ordinary income to you and reported accordingly.
                                                                <PAGE> 96

9.   Post-Retirement Survivor Income Benefit

As you know, upon your retirement you will be eligible for a post-
retirement survivor income benefit under the Family Protection Program
("FPP").  The post-retirement income benefit will provide a monthly
income benefit to your spouse for life should you predecease her after
you retire.  If FPP is ever amended or terminated to either limit or
eliminate the post-retirement survivor income benefit, Kodak agrees to
continue to provide this benefit to you.  The benefit will be provided on
substantially the same terms and conditions (e.g., amount and duration)
as if it were still being provided under the terms of FPP.  Kodak will
not have an obligation to fund the benefit and, consequently, the benefit
may at Kodak's discretion be paid from the company's assets.

10.  Benefits Not Benefits Bearing

In no event shall any of the benefits payable under this letter agreement
be "benefits bearing."  In other words, the amount of these benefits will
not be taken into account, nor considered for any reason, for purposes of
determining any company provided benefits or compensation to which you
may become eligible, including, by way of illustration and not by way of
limitation, the wage dividend.

11.  Release

In consideration for the benefits under Sections 3, 4, 8 and 9 of this
letter agreement, you hereby agree to execute immediately prior to your
termination of employment the release annexed hereto as Addendum A.  In
the event you either fail to sign the Addendum A or, once signed, make an
effective revocation of Addendum A, you will not be entitled to benefits
under Sections 3, 4, 8 and 9 of this letter agreement.

12.  Continued Cooperation

Following your retirement, Kodak may need your continued cooperation and
involvement with various pieces of litigation and other legal matters
which are now pending or which may arise after your retirement.  As
partial consideration for the benefits under this letter agreement, you
agree, at Kodak's request from time to time, to cooperate with Kodak in
its efforts to defend and/or pursue any such litigation or other legal
matters.  You further agree that you will provide this assistance to
Kodak at no additional remuneration beyond those benefits already being
provided to you under the terms of this letter agreement.  Furthermore,
in the event of your breach of this letter agreement, and regardless of
whatever actions or remedies Kodak pursues as a result thereof, you agree
to continue to perform the services required of you under this Section 12
of the letter agreement.  When performing these services at Kodak's
request, Kodak agrees to reimburse you for the reasonable travel and
lodging expenses you incur upon submission of such documentation as is
normally required of Kodak employees in

                                                                <PAGE> 97

receiving reimbursement for similar types of expenses.  By way of
illustration and not by way of limitation, the types of services that may
be requested of you under this Section 12 include: attending strategy
sessions, attending preparations for trial, appearing at depositions,
executing affidavits and testifying at trials.

13.  Employees' Agreement

During your employment by Kodak, you signed an "Eastman Kodak Company
Employee's Agreement" in which you reaffirmed your obligation not to
disclose company trade secret, confidential or proprietary information.
Further, you agreed not to engage in work or activities on behalf of a
competitor of Kodak's in the field in which you were employed by Kodak
for a period of two (2) years following termination of your employment by
Kodak.  By signing this letter agreement, you reaffirm the Employee's
Agreement and agree that it is, and will be at the time of your
termination, in full force and effect, without amendment or modification.

To the extent you locate one or more opportunities in any field or fields
in which you have worked for Kodak, Kodak agrees, upon your request, to
promptly review the terms of each such employment opportunity to
determine whether such opportunity is in Kodak's opinion violative of the
terms of the Employee's Agreement.  All such requests should be submitted
directly to my attention.

14.  Miscellaneous

     A.   Confidentiality.  You will agree to keep the existence of this
          letter confidential except that you may review it with your
