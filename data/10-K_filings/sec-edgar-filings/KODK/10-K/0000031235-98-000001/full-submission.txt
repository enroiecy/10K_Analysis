                                 PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company or Kodak) is engaged primarily in
developing, manufacturing and marketing consumer and commercial imaging
products.  Kodak's sales, earnings and identifiable assets by industry
segment for the past three years are shown in Segment Information on page
48.
- - ----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSUMER IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the Consumer Imaging segment, including intersegment sales, for
1997, 1996 and 1995 were (in millions) $7,681, $7,659 and $6,830,
respectively.

The products of the Consumer Imaging segment are used for capturing,
recording or displaying a consumer originated image.  For example,
traditional amateur photography requires, at a minimum, a camera, film and
photofinishing.  Photofinishing requires equipment and supplies, including
chemicals and paper for prints.

Kodak manufactures and markets various components of imaging systems.  For
traditional amateur photography, Kodak supplies films, photographic papers,
processing services, photographic chemicals, cameras (including single-use)
and projectors.  The Advanced Photo System is an amateur system of cameras,
films and photofinishing which delivers a variety of consumer features such
as drop-in loading, multiple print size options, index prints, and
negatives returned in the cartridge.  Kodak has also developed digital
camera systems which do not use silver halide film technology.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's consumer imaging products and services
are distributed worldwide through a variety of channels.  Individual
products are often used in substantial quantities in more than one market.
Most sales of the Consumer Imaging segment are made through retailers.
Independent retail outlets selling Kodak amateur products total many
thousands.  In a few areas abroad, Kodak products are marketed by
independent national distributors.  Certain products may be purchased
through the Internet.

Kodak's advertising programs actively promote its products and services in
its various markets, and its principal trademarks, trade dress and
corporate symbol are widely used and recognized.

Kodak's consumer imaging products and services compete with similar
products and services of others.  Competition in traditional imaging
markets is strong throughout the world.  Many large and small companies
offer similar products and services that compete with Kodak's business.
Kodak's products are continually improved to meet the changing needs and
preferences of its customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the Consumer Imaging segment are
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential
materials in traditional photographic film and paper manufacturing.
Digital electronics are becoming more prevalent in product offerings.
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                   <PAGE> 3

COMMERCIAL IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the Commercial Imaging segment, including intersegment sales, for
1997, 1996 and 1995 were (in millions) $6,888, $8,340 and $8,184,
respectively.

The Commercial Imaging segment consists of businesses that serve the
imaging and information needs of commercial customers.  Products in this
segment are used to capture, store, process and display images and
information in a variety of forms.

Kodak products for the Commercial Imaging segment include films,
photographic papers, photographic plates, chemicals, processing equipment
and audiovisual equipment, as well as copiers, graphic arts films,
microfilm products, applications software, printers and other business
equipment, supplies and service agreements to support these products.
These products serve professional photofinishers, professional
photographers, customers in the health care industry, and customers in
motion picture, television, commercial printing and publishing, office
automation, banking, insurance and government markets.  Recently introduced
commercial imaging products include digital and applied imaging products
which capture, store and print images in an electronic format.

Kodak Polychrome Graphics, a 50/50 joint venture with Sun Chemical
Corporation, was formed on December 31, 1997.  The joint venture will
assume responsibility for the photographic plate business, as well as for
the marketing of Kodak graphic arts films.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's commercial imaging products and
services are distributed through a variety of channels.  The Company also
sells and leases business equipment directly to users, and has a presence
on the Internet.  The Company manufactures copiers, which are sold and
serviced by Danka Business Systems PLC (Danka).

Kodak's commercial imaging products and services compete with similar
products and services of other small and large companies.  Strong
competition exists throughout the world in these markets.  Kodak's products
are continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its
customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the Commercial Imaging segment
are many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the
essential materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing.
Electronic components represent a significant portion of the cost of the
materials used in the manufacture of business equipment.

                                                                   <PAGE> 4

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - HEALTH BUSINESSES

In 1994, the Company divested its non-imaging health businesses and the
results of these businesses were reported as discontinued operations in
that year.  In 1996, the Company substantially completed negotiations with
buyers and filed tax returns associated with the sale of the non-imaging
health businesses.  As a result of these actions and a further assessment
of the liabilities recorded at the time of the sale, the Company recognized
a $277 million after-tax benefit in discontinued operations in 1996.
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Through the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in
research and development.  Research and development expenditures for
continuing operations for 1997, 1996 and 1995 were (in millions) $1,230,
$1,028 and $935, respectively.  The 1997 figure includes a $186 million
charge for the write-off of in-process research and development associated
with the acquisition of Wang Laboratories' software unit on March 17, 1997.

Research and development groups are located principally in the United
States in Rochester, New York.  Outside the U.S., research and development
groups are located principally in Australia, England, France, Japan and
Germany.  These groups, in close cooperation with manufacturing units and
marketing organizations, are constantly developing new products and
applications to serve both existing and new markets.

It has been Kodak's general practice to protect its investment in research
and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents
where feasible.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's
ability to use its inventions but at the same time is accompanied by patent
licensing.  While in the aggregate Kodak's patents are considered to be of
material importance in the operation of its business, the Company does not
consider that the patents relating to any single product or process are of
material significance when judged from the standpoint of its total
business.

                                                                   <PAGE> 5

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning
environmental matters.  Some of the U.S. federal environmental legislation
having an impact on Kodak includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act, and the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended (the Superfund law).

It is the policy of Eastman Kodak Company to carry out its business
activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and
environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health,
safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage
in a program for environmental protection and control.

Environmental protection is further discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings,
on page 6, and in the Notes to Financial Statements.  Refer to Note 1,
Significant Accounting Policies, Environmental Costs, on page 28, and Note
10, Commitments and Contingencies, on page 32.
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMPLOYMENT

At the end of 1997, the Company employed 97,500 people, of whom 54,800 were
employed in the U.S.

Financial information by geographic areas for the past three years is shown
in Segment Information on page 47.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The Consumer Imaging segment of Kodak's business in the United States is
centered in Rochester, New York, where photographic goods are manufactured.
Another manufacturing facility near Windsor, Colorado, also produces
sensitized photographic goods.

Consumer imaging manufacturing facilities outside the United States are
located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, India,
Indonesia, Mexico and Russia.  Kodak maintains marketing and distribution
facilities in many parts of the world.  The Company also owns processing
laboratories in numerous locations worldwide.

Products in the Commercial Imaging segment are manufactured in the United
States primarily in Rochester, New York and Windsor, Colorado.
Manufacturing facilities outside the United States are located in Brazil,
Canada, England, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan and Mexico.

Regional distribution centers are located in various places within and
outside of the United States.  The Company owns or leases administrative,
manufacturing, marketing and processing facilities in various parts of the
world.  The leases are for various periods and are generally renewable.
- - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In April 1987, the Company was sued in federal district court in San
Francisco by a number of independent service organizations who alleged
violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and of various state
statutes in the sale by the Company of repair parts for its copier and
micrographics equipment (Image Technical Service, Inc. et al v. Eastman
Kodak Company, "ITS").  The complaint sought unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages.  Trial began on June 19, 1995 and concluded on September
18, 1995 with a jury verdict for plaintiffs of $23,948,300 ($71,844,900
after trebling).  The Company appealed the jury's verdict, and on August
26, 1997 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rendered its decision affirming
in part and reversing in part.  The court affirmed the jury's liability
rulings, but reduced damages (after trebling) from $71,844,900 to
$35,818,200, and narrowed the scope of the injunction under which the
Company is required to make parts available.  Although the Company intends
to continue its vigorous defense of ITS, and in this connection has
petitioned for Supreme Court review, the Company took a third quarter pre-
tax charge of $46,000,000.

Three cases that raise essentially the same antitrust issues as ITS are
pending (Nationwide, et al v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed March 10, 1995,
A-1 Copy Center, et al v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed December 13, 1993,
and Broward Microfilm, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed February 27,
1996).  The Nationwide and A-1 cases are pending in federal district court
in San Francisco, while Broward Microfilm is pending in federal district
court in Miami.  A-1 is a consolidated class action, while Broward
Microfilm purports to be a national class action.  The complaints in all
three cases seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  The
Company is defending these matters vigorously.


                                                                   <PAGE> 7

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP)
under the Superfund law, or under similar state laws, for environmental
assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the Company's alleged
arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at approximately twenty-
five Superfund sites.  With respect to each of these sites, the Company's
actual or potential allocated share of responsibility is small.
Furthermore, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated at these
sites and, although the law imposes joint and several liability on PRPs, as
a practical matter, costs are shared with other PRPs.  Settlements and
costs paid by the Company in Superfund matters to date have not been
material.  Future costs are not expected to be material to the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

1997 COMPARED WITH 1996

Worldwide sales for 1997 were 9% lower than in 1996, largely due to the
impact of the divestiture of the Company's Office Imaging business in
December 1996 and the significant adverse effects of the stronger U.S.
dollar.  Currency changes against the dollar unfavorably affected sales by
$558 million in 1997 compared with 1996.  Excluding the effects of currency
rate changes and the Office Imaging divestiture, sales increased 3%.

Consumer Imaging segment sales for the year were level, as higher unit
volumes were offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes and lower effective selling prices.  Without the effect of currency
rate changes, sales increased 4%.  Sales increased 5% in the U.S. but
decreased 3% outside the U.S.  Of the $158 million increase in the U.S.,
$117 million is a result of the inclusion of a full year's revenue in 1997
for Fox Photo, Inc., which was acquired in October 1996.

Worldwide film sales were level, as a 7% volume increase was offset by the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective
selling prices.  U.S. film sales increased 3%, with 5% volume growth
partially offset by lower effective selling prices.  Outside the U.S., film
sales decreased 2%, with 9% volume growth more than offset by the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective
selling prices.

Worldwide color paper sales decreased 4%, as 8% volume gains were more than
offset by lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of
foreign currency rate changes.  U.S. sales decreased 13%, due to a 7%
decline in unit volumes caused by recent consolidation of the U.S.
photofinishing industry, as well as lower effective selling prices.  Paper
sales outside the U.S. increased 2%, driven by a 17% volume increase
partially offset by lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable
effects of foreign currency rate changes.  Sales increases reflect the
impact of continuing growth in emerging markets and new customers gained in
Europe.

Commercial Imaging segment sales for the year decreased 17%.  Excluding the
sales of Office Imaging from both years, sales decreased 2% (or increased
1% excluding the effects of the stronger dollar), as higher unit volumes
were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate
changes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales of Digital & Applied
Imaging products and Entertainment Imaging films grew, while sales declined
in all other businesses.

Earnings from operations declined 93%.  Excluding restructuring costs,
asset impairments and other charges totaling $1,455 million ($165 million
included in cost of goods sold) in 1997 and $358 million in 1996, earnings
from operations declined 28% as the benefits of higher unit volumes and
manufacturing productivity were more than offset by lower effective selling
prices, the Wang charge and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency
rate changes.  Approximately $221 million of the decline in earnings from
operations was due to currency rate changes.
                                                                  <PAGE> 12
                                                                           
Earnings from operations in the Consumer Imaging segment decreased 49%.
Excluding restructuring costs, asset impairments and other charges totaling
$516 million in 1997 and $183 million in 1996, earnings from operations
declined 17% as the benefits of higher unit volumes were more than offset
by lower effective selling prices and the unfavorable effects of foreign
currency rate changes.

In the Commercial Imaging segment, the Company reported an operating loss
of $451 million in 1997, compared with operating earnings of $704 million
in 1996.  Excluding restructuring costs, asset impairments and other
charges totaling $939 million in 1997 and $175 million in 1996, earnings
from operations declined 44% as the benefits of higher unit volumes and
manufacturing productivity were more than offset by lower effective selling
prices, the Wang charge and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency
rate changes.  Losses on the Company's digital products portfolio (in both
the Commercial and Consumer segments) were approximately $440 million in
1997, including about $130 million in the fourth quarter, due to continuing
declines in the writable compact disc business, investments in the network
services program, an operating loss in the Eastman Software subsidiary and
losses in the digital camera business.

Research and development expenditures were $1,044 million (excluding the
Wang charge of $186 million) in 1997 and $1,028 million in 1996.  Goodwill
charges were $80 million in 1997 and $66 million in 1996.  Advertising
expenses were $988 million in 1997 and $1,026 million in 1996.  Other
marketing and administrative expenses decreased from $3,384 million in 1996
to $2,924 million in 1997, primarily due to the sale of the Office Imaging
business in December 1996.

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues decreased 37%, reflecting
lower interest income (due to lower cash balances) and fewer gains on the
sale of capital assets.  Excluding the $387 million pre-tax loss on the
sale of Office Imaging in 1996, other costs increased 57%, primarily due to
the ITS charge and $32 million of increased losses on foreign exchange.

The effective tax rates were 34% in both 1997 and 1996, excluding
restructuring, asset impairments and other charges from both 1997 and 1996,
and the sale of the Office Imaging business from 1996.

On December 18, 1997, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
approved a fourth-quarter $1.5 billion charge for restructuring the
Company's operations, as well as revaluing certain assets.  About half of
the charge represents separation payments to be made to approximately
16,100 employees whose positions will be eliminated.  The other half of the
charge will cover the cost of asset write-downs and other costs associated
with plans to reposition certain non-strategic businesses.  The employment
reductions will be from an August 31 base of approximately 100,500
employees worldwide, and will be in addition to approximately 2,000
positions that remain to be eliminated during 1998 under a restructuring
reserve taken in the fourth quarter of 1996, and another 800 positions to
be terminated in 1998 under a reserve taken in the second quarter of 1997.
Refer to Note 13 on page 38.
                                                                  <PAGE> 13

As a result of the actions covered by this charge, and other cost-reduction
initiatives, the Company expects to reduce its total cost structure by $500
million in 1998 and an additional $500 million in 1999, resulting in annual
cost savings of $1 billion.  Some of these savings will be reflected in
earnings, which not only allows the Company to improve its results of
operations, but also enhances its competitiveness.  In addition, the
Company will continue to invest in growth opportunities.

Although the Company's cost-reduction efforts will position it for an
improved 1998, the growing strength of the U.S. dollar, continuing
competitive pressures and the phased implementation of the cost-reduction
program will make it likely that results during the first quarter of 1998
will be below those of 1997.

1996 COMPARED WITH 1995

Worldwide sales in 1996 were 7% higher than in 1995, primarily due to
higher unit volumes.  Currency changes against the dollar unfavorably
affected sales by $243 million in 1996 compared with 1995.

Consumer Imaging segment sales for the year were up 12%, primarily due to
higher unit volumes partially offset by lower effective selling prices and
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.  Sales increased both
inside and outside the U.S.  Strong color film and paper volumes,
photofinishing increases in Qualex and sales of Advantix products led the
gains.

Commercial Imaging segment sales for the year were up 2%, primarily due to
higher unit volumes partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign
currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales increased
outside the U.S., but were level in the U.S.  Declines in Office Imaging
partially offset strong sales gains by Entertainment Imaging and continued
growth in Business Imaging Systems and Digital & Applied Imaging.

Earnings from operations decreased 5%; however, excluding 1996
restructuring costs of $358 million, earnings from operations increased
13%, as the benefits of higher unit volumes and manufacturing productivity
were somewhat offset by lower effective selling prices and higher
advertising expenditures.

Earnings from operations in the Consumer Imaging segment decreased 9%;
however, excluding 1996 restructuring costs of $183 million, earnings from
operations increased 6%, as the benefits of higher unit volumes and
manufacturing productivity were partially offset by lower effective selling
prices and higher advertising expenditures.

Earnings from operations in the Commercial Imaging segment increased 2%;
however, excluding 1996 restructuring costs of $175 million, earnings from
operations increased 28%, as the benefits of manufacturing productivity and
higher unit volumes were somewhat offset by lower effective selling prices,
higher research and development expenditures, and unfavorable effects of
foreign currency rate changes.
                                                                  <PAGE> 14

Research and development expenditures were $1,028 million in 1996 and $935
million in 1995.  Goodwill charges were $66 million in 1996 and $109
million in 1995.  The 1995 figure includes write-offs of intangible assets
of $54 million, principally associated with the Health Imaging business.
Advertising expenses totaled $1,026 million in 1996 and $840 million in
1995.  Other marketing and administrative expenses totaled $3,384 million
in 1996 and $3,318 million in 1995.

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues decreased 5%, primarily
due to lower income from equity interests.  Excluding the $387 million pre-
tax loss on the sale of the Office Imaging business from 1996, other costs
decreased 54%, mostly due to lower foreign exchange losses.

The effective tax rates were 34% in 1996, excluding restructuring costs and
the sale of the Office Imaging business, and 35% in 1995.  The lower
effective tax rate in 1996 principally results from the utilization of
certain foreign tax loss carryforwards.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash provided by operating activities in 1997 was $2,080 million, as
net earnings of $5 million, which included non-cash expenses for
restructuring, asset impairments and other charges of $1,415 million (less
related deferred income tax benefits), depreciation and amortization of
$828 million and a $186 million R&D charge associated with the purchase of
Wang Laboratories' software unit, were partially offset by decreases in
liabilities (excluding borrowings) of $349 million.  Net cash used in
investing activities of $1,896 million in 1997 was due primarily to
additions to properties of $1,485 million and acquisitions, net of cash
acquired, of $341 million.  Net cash used in financing activities of $1,198
million in 1997 was primarily due to $850 million of stock repurchases and
$567 million of dividend payments.

Cash dividends per share of $1.76, $1.60 and $1.60, payable quartely, were
declared in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  Total cash dividends of
approximately $567 million, $539 million and $547 million were paid in
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year-end 1997 were $752
million, a $1,044 million decrease from the year-end 1996 total of $1,796
million.  Net working capital at year-end 1997 decreased to $298 million
from $1,548 million at year-end 1996.  Both decreases are primarily
attributable to the stock repurchase program and the acquisition of Wang
Laboratories' software unit.

The Company repurchased $850 million and $623 million of treasury shares in
1997 and 1996, respectively, under the $2 billion repurchase program
initiated in 1996.  In 1996, the Company also repurchased $700 million of
treasury shares under a previous repurchase program.  Completion of the $2
billion stock repurchase program will be funded by available cash reserves
and cash from operations.
                                                                  <PAGE> 15

Total short-term and long-term borrowings were $1,196 million at year-end
1997 and $1,100 million at year-end 1996.  The Company has access to a $3.5
billion revolving credit facility expiring in November 2001.  The Company
also has a shelf registration statement for debt securities with an
available balance of $2.2 billion.

Capital additions were $796 million and $599 million for the Consumer
Imaging segment in 1997 and 1996, respectively, and $689 million and $742
million for the Commercial Imaging segment.

OTHER

During 1997, the Company used the U.S. dollar as the functional currency
for its Brazilian operations as they operated in a highly inflationary
economy.  At June 30, 1997 the cumulative three year inflation rate in
Brazil dropped to 53%.  Although the Company maintained the U.S. dollar as
the functional currency for Brazil, the Company continues to monitor the
economic situation in Brazil.  Changing the functional currency for Brazil
to the Brazilian real would shift translation gains and losses, currently
included in earnings, to the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
The impact of such a change would not be significant to the Company.

In 1996, the Company established a formal global program office to assess
the impact of the Year 2000 issue on the software and hardware utilized in
its internal operations and included in its product offerings to customers.
The Company has plans such that all changes to this software and hardware
necessitated by the Year 2000 issue will be completed in a timely manner.
The currently estimated costs associated with these changes are not
material in any year and are not material to the Company's financial
position.  However, the Company could be adversely impacted if its
suppliers and customers do not make necessary changes to their own systems
and products successfully and in a timely manner.

In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings Per
Share."  This standard replaces primary earnings per share with basic
earnings per share and requires presentation of diluted earnings per share
as well as a reconciliation of basic earnings per share to diluted earnings
per share.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 in the fourth quarter of 1997
and all historical earnings per share data presented have been restated to
conform to the provisions of SFAS No. 128.

In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income."  Comprehensive income includes net income and several other items
that current accounting standards require to be recognized outside of net
income.  This standard requires enterprises to display comprehensive income
and its components in financial statements, to classify items of
comprehensive income by their nature in financial statements, and to
display the accumulated balances of other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity separately from retained earnings and additional paid-
in capital.  SFAS No. 130 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1997, and Kodak intends to adopt the standard for its fiscal
year beginning January 1, 1998.  The Company has determined that it will
display comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders'
Equity at December 31, 1998.
                                                                  <PAGE> 16

In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information," replacing SFAS No. 14 and its
amendments.  This standard requires enterprises to report certain
information about their operating segments in a complete set of financial
statements to shareholders; to report certain enterprise-wide information
about products and services, activities in different geographic areas, and
reliance on major customers; and to disclose certain segment information in
their interim financial statements.  The basis for determining an
enterprise's operating segments is the manner in which financial
information is used internally by the enterprise's chief operating decision
maker.  SFAS No. 131 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1997, and Kodak intends to adopt the standard for its fiscal year
beginning January 1, 1998.  The Company has not yet determined how the
"management approach" will impact existing segment disclosures.

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning
environmental matters.  Refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, on
page 32.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

Certain statements in this report may be forward-looking in nature, or
"forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are identified
by such words and phrases as "expects" and "could be."  For example, the
sentence in this report that reads, in part, "...the growing strength of
the U.S. dollar, continuing competitive pressures and the phased
implementation of the cost-reduction program will make it likely that
results during the first quarter of 1998 will be below those of 1997..." is
a forward-looking statement.  Also, references to the Company's $1 billion
cost-reduction initiative and to expected savings resulting from quality
improvements are forward-looking statements.

Actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in forward-
looking statements.  With respect to any forward-looking statements
contained in this report, the Company believes that it is subject to a
number of risk factors, including: the inherent unpredictablility of
currency fluctuations; competitive actions, including pricing; the ability
to realize cost reductions and operating efficiencies, including the
ability to implement headcount reduction programs timely and in a manner
that does not unduly disrupt business operations, and the ability to
identify and to realize other cost-reduction opportunities; and general
economic and business conditions.

Any forward-looking statements in this report should be evaluated in light
of these important risk factors.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financial activities,
is exposed to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of
operations and financial position.  In seeking to minimize the risks and/or
costs associated with such activities, the Company manages exposures to
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates through its regular operating and financing activities.  Pursuant to
Company policy, foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge
certain firm commitments and the currency risk inherent in the deposit
taking and lending activities of the Company's International Treasury
Center.  Option and futures contracts are used to mitigate the Company's
risk to fluctuating commodity prices.  The Company's exposure to changes in
interest rates results from its investing and borrowing activities used to
meet its liquidity needs.  Long-term debt is generally used to finance long-
term investments, while short-term debt is used to meet working capital
requirements.  Derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust the
Company's interest rate risk profile.  The Company does not utilize
financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does
it utilize leveraged financial instruments.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its
borrowing activities and less so through investments in marketable
securities.  The Company utilizes U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper
and borrowings as well as foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund
its working capital and investment needs.  The majority of short- and long-
term borrowings and marketable securities are in fixed rate instruments.
There is inherent roll-over risk for borrowings and marketable securities
as they mature and are renewed at current market rates.  The extent of this
risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of
future interest rates and business financing requirements.  Using a yield
to maturity analysis and assuming an increase in interest rates of 60 basis
points (about 10% movement in interest rates) with the December 31, 1997
level of debt and marketable securities, the potential decrease in fair
value of marketable securities, short-term and long-term borrowings would
be $1 million, $3 million and $25 million, respectively.
                                                                  <PAGE> 18

The majority of foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in
Australian, French, German, Irish, Spanish and British currencies.  The
magnitude and nature of such hedging activities are explained further in
Note 11, Financial Instruments, on page 34.  Assuming a 10% increase in
foreign currency exchange rates of currencies sold, the Company could incur
a $72 million loss on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at
December 31, 1997.  Such losses would be substantially offset by gains from
the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged.

The Company has entered into silver option and futures contracts to
minimize its exposure to increases in silver price in 1998.  Silver price
risk for 1997 was not hedged.  As of December 31, 1997, the Company had
hedged approximately 50% of its planned silver requirements for 1998.
Using broker quoted termination values and assuming a 10% decrease in
silver price from $5.99 per troy ounce at December 31, 1997, the decrease
in fair value of silver options and futures would be $17 million.  Such
losses in fair value, if realized, would be offset by lower costs of silver-
containing products manufactured during 1998.

                                                                  <PAGE> 19
                                                                           

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the
consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear on pages
21 through 49.  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and include certain amounts
that are based on management's best estimates and judgments.
  The Company's accounting systems include extensive internal controls
designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of its
financial records and the proper safeguarding and use of its assets.  Such
controls are based on established policies and procedures, are implemented
by trained, skilled personnel with an appropriate segregation of duties,
and are monitored through a comprehensive internal audit program.  The
Company's policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all
employees are to maintain the highest ethical standards and that its
business practices throughout the world are to be conducted in a manner
which is above reproach.
  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Price
Waterhouse LLP, independent accountants, who were responsible for
conducting their audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Their resulting report is shown below.
  The Board of Directors exercises its responsibility for these financial
statements through its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of non-
management Board members.  The independent accountants and internal
auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee.  The Audit
Committee meets periodically with the independent accountants and the
Director of Corporate Auditing, both privately and with management present,
to discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Eastman Kodak Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed
in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 52 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Eastman Kodak Company and subsidiary companies at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Eastman Kodak Company and Subsidiary Companies
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

COMPANY OPERATIONS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company or Kodak) is engaged primarily in
developing, manufacturing, and marketing consumer and commercial imaging
products.  The Company's products are manufactured in a number of
countries in North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.  The
Company's products are marketed and sold in many countries throughout the
world.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman
Kodak Company and its majority owned subsidiary companies.  Intercompany
transactions are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion
of the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to minority interests.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Certain significant estimates are disclosed throughout this report.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency
is the functional currency and translation adjustments are accumulated in
a separate component of shareholders' equity.

For subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose
economic environment is highly inflationary, the U.S. dollar is the
functional currency and gains and losses that result from translation are
included in earnings.  The effect from foreign currency translation was a
loss of $7 million in 1997, a loss of $4 million in 1996 and a gain of
$14 million in 1995.

The Company hedges certain foreign currency transactions and firm foreign
currency commitments by entering into forward exchange contracts.  Gains
and losses associated with currency rate changes on forward contracts
hedging foreign currency transactions are recorded currently in earnings.
The effects from foreign currency transactions, including related hedging
activities, were losses of $66 million in 1997, $37 million in 1996 and
$76 million in 1995.  Gains and losses related to hedges of firm
commitments are deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments of
carrying amounts when the transaction occurs.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months
or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
                                                                <PAGE> 27

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND NONCURRENT INVESTMENTS

Investments included in marketable securities of $23 million and $18
million, and in long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets of $26
million and $46 million, at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively, are
considered held to maturity.  Investments included in marketable
securities of $1 million and $1 million, and in long-term receivables and
other noncurrent assets of $49 million and $59 million, at December 31,
1997 and 1996, respectively, are considered available for sale.  The
maturities of long-term receivables range from 1999 to 2017.

Proceeds from the sale of securities were $15 million, $59 million and
$48 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  No gain or loss was
realized from the sale of these securities in 1997, 1996 or 1995.
Specific identification was used to determine the cost of securities
sold.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of market.  The
cost of most inventories in the U.S. is determined by the "last-in, first-
out" (LIFO) method.  The cost of other inventories is determined by the
"first-in, first-out" (FIFO) or average cost method.

PROPERTIES

Properties are recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense is provided based on historical cost and estimated
useful lives ranging from approximately five years to fifty years for
buildings and building equipment and three years to twenty years for
machinery and equipment. The Company generally uses the straight-line
method for calculating the provision for depreciation.  The Company
regularly assesses all of its long-lived assets for impairment, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."

GOODWILL

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period
estimated to be benefited, not exceeding fifteen years.  The carrying
value of goodwill is assessed periodically based on the expected future
cash flows of the asset grouping associated with the goodwill.

REVENUE

Revenue is recognized from the sale of film, paper, supplies and
equipment (including sales-type leases for equipment) when the product is
shipped; from maintenance and service contracts over the contractual
period, or as the services are performed; from rentals under operating
leases in the month in which they are earned; and from financing
transactions at level rates of return over the term of the lease or
receivable.
                                                                <PAGE> 28

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in "selling,
general and administrative expenses."  Advertising expenses amounted to
$988 million, $1,026 million and $840 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed
or capitalized, as appropriate.  Remediation costs that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is
probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably
estimated.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes.
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between
the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting
purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128,
"Earnings Per Share," for all periods presented.  Basic earnings per
share computations are based on the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the year.  Diluted earnings per share
calculations reflect the assumed exercise and conversion of employee
stock options.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications of 1996 and 1995 financial statement and
related footnote amounts have been made to conform with the 1997
presentation.

NOTE 2:  SALE OF ASSETS

On December 31, 1996, Danka Business Systems PLC (Danka) and Kodak
entered into an agreement for Danka to acquire the sales, marketing and
equipment service operations of Kodak's Office Imaging business, as well
as Kodak's facilities management business known as Kodak Imaging
Services.  In connection with this agreement, Kodak will supply high-
volume copiers and printers to Danka.  Danka paid Kodak $559 million in
cash, net of final adjustments, in exchange for certain assets and the
assumption of certain operating liabilities.  The book value of net
assets sold was $716 million.  The Company recorded amounts for employee
separation payments, contract termination payments, transaction costs and
other significant items.  As a result of this transaction, the Company
recognized a pre-tax loss of $387 million in other costs.  The after-tax
loss was $252 million.

NOTE 3:  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 1994, the Company sold the pharmaceutical and consumer health
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and do-it-
yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics
Division.  In computing the net gain from discontinued operations, the
Company recorded amounts for environmental exposures, product
liabilities, buyer indemnifications, purchase price adjustments, taxes
and other significant items based on the best estimates available at the
time the transactions occurred.  The Company has substantially completed
negotiations with buyers and filed tax returns associated with the sale
of the non-imaging health businesses.  As a result of these actions and a
further assessment of the liabilities recorded at the time of the sale,
the Company recognized a $277 million after-tax benefit in discontinued
operations in 1996, the primary component of which was income and other
taxes.  While the remaining balances included in these reserves are
believed to be appropriate based on management's current judgments,
changes could occur as audits and other activities related to these
transactions are completed.

Short-term bank borrowings totaled $611 million at year-end 1997 and $296
million at year-end 1996.  Year-end 1997 borrowings included $227 million
of commercial paper.  Year-end 1996 borrowings were primarily by
subsidiaries outside the U.S.  The weighted-average interest rate was
6.0% in 1997 and 7.0% in 1996.

The Company has a $3.5 billion unused revolving credit facility
established in 1996 and expiring in November 2001 which is available to
support the Company's commercial paper program and for general corporate
purposes.  If unused, it has a commitment fee of $1.9 million per year.
Interest on amounts borrowed under this facility is calculated at rates
based on spreads above certain reference rates.

At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company's undiscounted accrued
liabilities for environmental remediation costs amounted to $118 million
and $106 million, respectively.

The Company expects these recurring and remediation costs and capital
expenditures to increase in the future.  It is not expected that these
costs will have an impact materially different from 1997's environmental
expenditures on the Company's financial position, results of operations,
cash flows or competitive position.

American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of
Position (SOP) 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities, became
effective for the Company on January 1, 1997.  The SOP defines the stages
of an environmental remediation when liabilities related to the
remediation should be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position, as well as the costs included in the liability.  The
impact of the SOP on the Company's results of operations and financial
position was not significant.

In October 1994, the Company, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
and the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement of a civil
complaint alleging noncompliance by the Company with federal
environmental regulations at the Company's Kodak Park manufacturing site
in Rochester, New York.  The Company paid a penalty of $5 million.  A
Consent Decree was signed under which the Company is subject to a
Compliance Schedule by which the Company improved its waste
characterization procedures, upgraded one of its incinerators, and is
evaluating and upgrading its industrial sewer system.  The total
expenditures required to complete this program are currently estimated to
be approximately $55 million over the next eight years.  These
expenditures are primarily capital in nature.

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP)
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the Superfund law), or under similar
state laws, for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result
of the Company's alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous
substances at approximately twenty-five Superfund sites.  With respect to
each of these sites, the Company's actual or potential allocated share of
responsibility is small.  Furthermore, numerous other PRPs have similarly
been designated at these sites and, although the law imposes joint and
several liability on PRPs, as a practical matter, costs are shared with
other PRPs.  Settlements and costs paid by the Company in Superfund
matters to date have not been material.  Future costs are also not
expected to be material to the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

                                                                <PAGE> 33

In addition to the foregoing environmental actions, the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining
to the Kodak Park site in Rochester, N.Y.  is nearly complete and the
Company has completed a broad-based assessment of the site in response to
the RFA.  While future expenditures associated with any remediation
activities could be significant, the Company is currently in the process
of completing the RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI).  Upon completion of
the RFI, the Company expects to have developed estimates of the required
remediation costs.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  Expenditures to
comply with the Clean Air Act implementing regulations issued to date
have not been material and have been primarily capital in nature.  Future
capital expenditures cannot be reasonably estimated at the present time,
as certain of the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to this Act have
not been issued.

The Company has retained certain obligations for environmental
remediation matters related to the non-imaging health businesses sold in
1994.  Actions to fulfill these obligations are not expected to be
completed in the near term and costs related to the obligations are
included in remediation accruals recorded at December 31, 1997.

The Company has entered into agreements with several companies to provide
the Company with products and services to be used in its normal
operations.  The minimum payments for these agreements are approximately
$116 million in 1998, $116 million in 1999, $76 million in 2000, $14
million in 2001 and $13 million in 2002.

The Company has also guaranteed debt and other obligations under
agreements with certain affiliated companies and customers.  At December
31, 1997, these guarantees totaled approximately $154 million.  The
Company does not expect that these guarantees will have a material impact
on the Company's future financial position or results of operations.

The Company has issued letters of credit totaling $93 million to ensure
the completion of environmental remediations and payment of possible
casualty and Workers' Compensation claims.

Rental expense, net of minor sublease income, amounted to $182 million in
1997, $207 million in 1996 and $189 million in 1995.  The approximate
amounts of noncancelable lease commitments with terms of more than one
year, principally for the rental of real property, reduced by minor
sublease income, are $135 million in 1998, $102 million in 1999, $75
million in 2000, $52 million in 2001, $34 million in 2002 and $59 million
in 2003 and thereafter.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits,
claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability,
commercial, environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being
handled and defended in the ordinary course of business.  There are no
such matters pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to
be material in relation to the Company's business, financial position or
results of operations.

The fair values of long-term borrowings were determined by reference to
quoted market prices or by obtaining quotes from dealers.  Marketable
securities and other investments are valued at quoted market prices,
except for $25 million and $31 million of equity investments included in
other investments at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively, which are
reflected at their carrying value because it is not practical to estimate
fair value as quoted market prices do not exist.  The fair values for the
remaining financial instruments in the above table are based on dealer
quotes and reflect the estimated amounts the Company would pay or receive
to terminate the contracts.  The carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, short-term borrowings and payables approximate
their fair values.

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financing
activities, is exposed to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of
operations and financial position.  In seeking to minimize the risks
and/or costs associated with such activities, the Company manages
exposures to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing
activities.  Pursuant to Company policy, foreign currency forward
contracts are used to hedge certain firm commitments and the currency
risk inherent in the deposit taking and lending activities of the
Company's International Treasury Center.  Option and futures contracts
are used to mitigate the Company's risk to fluctuating commodity prices.
The Company's exposure to changes in interest rates results from its
investing and borrowing activities used to meet its liquidity needs.
Long-term debt is generally used to finance long-term investments, while
short-term debt is used to meet working capital requirements.  Derivative
instruments are not presently used to adjust the Company's interest rate
risk profile.  The Company does not utilize financial instruments for
trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged
financial instruments.
                                                                <PAGE> 35

The table below summarizes by major currency the notional amounts of
foreign currency forward contracts in U.S. dollars.  The counter-currency
for the majority of the contracts is the U.S. dollar, while some
contracts are cross-currency with one foreign currency traded for
another.  Foreign currency amounts are translated at rates current at the
reporting date.  The "buy" amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent
of commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts
represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign
currencies.  Substantially all of the Company's foreign currency forward
agreements will mature during 1998.  The market risk related to foreign
currency forward contracts is substantially offset by changes in the
valuation and cash flows of the underlying positions hedged.

During 1997, the Company entered into option and futures contracts to
minimize its exposure to increases in silver price for 1998.  Silver
options and futures entered into have notional amounts of $73 million and
$74 million, respectively, which expire in the first and second quarters
of 1998.  All silver hedging contracts are settled in cash.  Gains and
losses related to silver hedges are recorded as adjustments to the
carrying amount of silver inventory when purchased, and recognized in
results of operations as silver-containing products are sold.  The market
risk related to silver options and futures is substantially offset by
changes in the cost of silver purchased.

The Company's financial instrument counterparties are high quality
investment or commercial banks with significant experience with such
instruments.  The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk
through specific minimum
credit standards and diversification of counterparties.  The Company has
procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts.  The maximum credit
exposure at December 31, 1997 was not significant to the Company.

The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to certain net
operating loss carryforwards outside the U.S.  A majority of the net
operating loss carryforwards are subject to a five-year expiration
period.

Retained earnings of subsidiary companies outside the U.S. were
approximately $792 million and $1,466 million at December 31, 1997 and
1996, respectively.  Retained earnings at December 31, 1997 are
considered to be reinvested indefinitely.  If remitted, they would be
substantially free of additional tax.  It is not practicable to determine
the deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these
retained earnings.

NOTE 13:  RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS

1997 Program

In December 1997, the Company committed to implement a restructuring
program and recorded a pre-tax provision of $1,455 million for severance
and other termination benefits and exit costs related to the realignment
of the Company's worldwide manufacturing, sales and marketing, research
and development (R&D), and administrative operations.  The Company
recorded $165 million of the $1,455 million provision as cost of goods
sold.  The remaining $1,290 million includes $862 million of
restructuring costs and $428 million of asset impairments.  Severance
costs for 16,100 personnel included in the restructuring provision
resulted from capacity reductions in manufacturing facilities (7,950
personnel), and service and photofinishing operations (2,675 personnel);
and the consolidation of sales and marketing (1,425 personnel), R&D
(1,000 personnel) and administrative (3,050 personnel) functions in
various locations of the Company's worldwide operations.  Approximately
1,350 personnel had been terminated by the end of 1997.  Most of the
remaining terminations are expected to be completed by December 31, 1998.

The following table summarizes the costs associated with the 1997
program:

1996 Program

The Company recorded a pre-tax provision of $358 million in 1996 for
severance and other termination benefits for approximately 3,900
personnel and exit costs related to the realignment of the Company
worldwide.  The $358 million provision included $299 million of
restructuring costs.  The principal purpose of this program is to
eliminate infrastructure and operational inefficiencies and redundancies
throughout the Company by taking actions to separate personnel, close
facilities and exit non-strategic businesses.  A portion of the program
includes the restructuring of retail and wholesale photofinishing
operations, primarily outside the U.S.  Additionally, the plan addressed
certain infrastructure activities which supported the Office Imaging
business, which was sold to Danka Business Systems PLC.  Approximately
1,900 personnel had been terminated by the end of 1997.  The remaining
terminations are expected to be completed during 1998.

NOTE 14:  RETIREMENT PLANS

Substantially all U.S. employees are covered by a noncontributory plan,
the Kodak Retirement Income Plan (KRIP), which is funded by Company
contributions to an irrevocable trust fund.  Generally, benefits are
based on a formula recognizing length of service and final average
earnings.  Assets in the fund are held for the sole benefit of
participating employees and retirees.  The assets of the trust fund are
comprised of corporate equity and debt securities, U.S. government
securities, partnership and joint venture investments, interests in
pooled funds, and various types of interest rate and foreign currency
financial instruments.  Kodak common stock represents approximately 6.5%
of trust assets.

The benefit obligations for KRIP include amounts for employees who
retired from Eastman Chemical Company (ECC) on or before December 31,
1993, the date ECC was spun off from the Company.  Benefit obligations of
all other ECC employees were transferred to ECC as part of the spin-off
agreement.  The benefit obligation of KRIP excludes amounts for all
employees (both retired and active) of the non-imaging health businesses
sold in 1994 because those obligations were transferred to the buyers of
the non-imaging health businesses.  The market value of KRIP assets as
shown below reflects the Company's share of KRIP assets held for
employees and retirees.  The transfer of assets from the KRIP trust fund
to ECC was completed as of July 30, 1997.  The transfer of assets from
the KRIP trust fund to the buyers of the non-imaging health businesses
was not completed as of December 31, 1997.

The Company retained the obligation for employees of the Office Imaging
sales, marketing and equipment service functions and recorded a $12
million curtailment loss in 1996 as a result of the sale of this
business, which is included in the loss on the sale.

Funding policy for KRIP is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet
minimum funding requirements as determined by employee benefit and tax
laws plus additional amounts the Company determines to be appropriate.

Most subsidiaries and branches operating outside the U.S. have retirement
plans covering substantially all employees.  Contributions by the Company
for these plans are typically deposited under government or other
fiduciary-type arrangements.  Retirement benefits are generally based on
contractual agreements that provide for benefit formulas using years of
service and/or compensation prior to retirement.  The actuarial
assumptions used for these plans reflect the diverse economic
environments within the various countries in which the Company operates.

The Company also sponsors an unfunded plan for certain U.S. employees
(primarily executives).  The benefits of this plan are obtained by
applying KRIP provisions to all compensation, including compensation
currently being deferred, and without regard to the legislated qualified
plan maximums, reduced by benefits under KRIP.  At December 31, 1997 and
1996, the projected benefit obligations of this plan amounted to $222
million and $197 million, respectively.  The Company had recorded long-
term liabilities at those dates of $195 million and $179 million,
respectively.  Pension expense recorded in 1997, 1996 and 1995 related to
this plan was $25 million, $24 million and $17 million, respectively.

NOTE 15:  NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company provides health care, dental and life insurance benefits to
U.S. eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees.  In general,
these benefits are provided to U.S. retirees that are covered by the
Company's principal pension plan (KRIP).  These benefits are funded from
the general assets of the Company as they are incurred.  Certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries offer health care benefits; however, the cost of such
benefits is insignificant to the Company.

Net nonpension postretirement benefit cost includes the following:

The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

                                       1997      1996

Discount rate                           7.0%      7.5%

The Company recorded a $97 million curtailment gain in 1996 as a result
of the sale of the Office Imaging business, which is included in the loss
on the sale.

Increasing the health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
approximately $112 million as of December 31, 1997 and increase the net
postretirement benefit cost for 1997 by approximately $9 million.

NOTE 16:  STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company's stock incentive plans consist of the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term
Compensation Plan (the 1995 Plan), the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term
Compensation Plan (the 1990 Plan) and the 1985 Stock Option Plan (the
1985 Plan).  The Plans are administered by the Executive Compensation and
Development Committee of the Board of Directors.

Under the 1995 Plan, 16 million shares of the Company's common stock may
be granted to a variety of employees between February 1, 1995 and
December 31, 1999.  Option prices are not less than 100% of the per share
fair market value on the date of grant, and the options generally expire
ten years from the dates of grant, but may expire sooner if the
optionee's employment terminates.  The 1995 Plan also provides for Stock
Appreciation Rights (SARs) to be granted, either in tandem with options
or freestanding.  SARs allow optionees to receive payment equal to the
difference between the Company's stock market price on grant date and
exercise date.  At December 31, 1997, 536,490 freestanding SARs were
outstanding at option prices ranging from $54.38 to $90.63.

Under the 1990 Plan, 16 million shares of the Company's common stock
could be granted to key employees between February 1, 1990 and January
31, 1995.  Option prices could not be less than 50% of the per share fair
market value on the date of grant; however, no options below fair market
value were granted.  The options generally expire ten years from the
dates of grant, but may expire sooner if the optionee's employment
terminates.  The 1990 Plan also provided that options with dividend
equivalents, tandem SARs and freestanding SARs could be granted.  At
December 31, 1997, 100,561 tandem SARs and 221,711 freestanding SARs were
outstanding at option prices ranging from $31.45 to $44.50.

Under the 1985 Plan, approximately 1 million options, 119,583 tandem SARs
and 22,359 freestanding SARs were outstanding at December 31, 1997, at
option prices ranging from $33.79 to $36.64.  The 1985 Plan terms are
similar to the 1995 Plan terms.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," in accounting for employee
stock options.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized
for stock option plans.

Pro forma net earnings and earnings per share information, as required by
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options
under SFAS No. 123's fair value method.  The fair value of these options
was estimated at grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with 
the following weighted-average assumptions for 1997, 1996 and 1995:

                                            1997           1996          1995

Risk free interest rates                     6.7%           6.3%          6.9%
Expected option lives                     7 years        7 years       7 years
Expected volatilities                         25%            25%           25%
Expected dividend yields                    2.32%          2.25%         3.00%

The weighted-average fair values of options granted were $25.76, $22.84
and $17.43 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period (3
years).  The Company's pro forma information follows:

This disclosure is not likely to be representative of the effects on
reported net earnings for future years, because options vest over three
years and additional awards generally are made each year.

NOTE 17:  ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES

On March 17, 1997, the Company acquired Wang Laboratories' software
business unit for approximately $260 million in cash.  The unit is
engaged in the development of workflow, imaging, document management and
network storage management software.  The transaction was accounted for
by the purchase method and, accordingly, the operating results of the
business have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge
of $186 million in purchased research and development expense in the
first quarter.  The amount attributed to purchased research and
development was determined by a nationally recognized independent
valuation firm through established valuation techniques in the high
technology document imaging industry.  The amount was expensed upon
acquisition as the technology has not reached technological feasibility
and has no alternative future use.

On September 2, 1997, the Company announced the completion of a program
to increase its stake in Chinon Industries, Inc. from 12% to 50.1%.  The
Company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Chinon beginning September 2.  Kodak and Chinon closely collaborate on
the development and production of digital cameras; Chinon also produces
Kodak's IL-500 scanner.  Kodak and Chinon will continue to collaborate on
engineering and development of digital cameras and scanners.

On October 2, 1997, the Company purchased CPI's 49% interest in the Fox
Photo, Inc. joint venture for $10 million in cash and a $43.9 million
note due on January 4, 1999.  The two companies formed the photospecialty
retailing venture in October 1996 with Kodak purchasing 51% of the stock
in the venture for $56.1 million and CPI contributing its retail
operations.  The transaction was accounted for by the purchase method

corporation, firm or association of any type or kind in which one or more
of this corporation's directors are directors or are otherwise
interested, shall be void or voidable solely by reason of such common
directorship or interest, or solely because such director or directors
are present at the meeting of the Board or a committee thereof which
authorizes or approves the contract or transaction, or solely because his
or their votes are counted for such purpose, (1) if the contract or other
transaction is fair and reasonable as to the corporation at the time it
is authorized, approved or ratified; (2) or the fact of the common
directorship or interest is disclosed or known to the Board or committee
and the Board or committee authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract

shall discharge their duties to the corporation when they act in good
faith and with that degree of diligence, care and skill which ordinarily
prudent men would exercise under similar circumstances in like positions.
In discharging their duties, directors and members of any such committee
shall not be liable if, acting in good faith, they rely (a) upon the
opinion of counsel for the corporation, or (b) upon written reports
setting forth financial data concerning the corporation and prepared by
an independent public accountant or certified public accountant or firm
of such accountants, or (c) upon financial statements, books of account
or reports of the corporation represented to them to be correct by the
President, the officer of the corporation having charge of its books of
account, or the person presiding at a meeting of the Board.

They shall also be signed by or bear the facsimile signature of one of

Section 4.  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.

     Where a certificate for shares has been lost, apparently destroyed,
or wrongfully taken and the owner thereof fails to so notify the
corporation or the Transfer Agent within a reasonable time after he has
notice of the fact and the Transfer Agent or the corporation registers a
transfer of the shares before receiving such a notification, the owner
shall be precluded from asserting against the corporation any claim for
registering the transfer of such shares or any claim to a new
certificate.
                                                                <PAGE> 70

     Subject to the foregoing, where the owner of shares claims that the
certificate representing such shares has been lost, destroyed, or
wrongfully taken, the corporation shall issue a new certificate in place
of the original certificate if the registered owner thereof, or his legal
representative, (a) requests the issue of a new certificate before the
corporation has notice that the certificate has been acquired by a bona
fide purchaser; (b) makes proof in such form as the corporation may
prescribe of his ownership of the shares represented by the certificate
and that the certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken;
(c) files either (i) an assumption of liability by a surety approved by
the corporation under a blanket lost instrument indemnity bond,
substantially in the form approved by the corporation, or (ii) an
indemnity bond in such form and with such surety and in such amount (open
or specified) as may be approved by the corporation, indemnifying the
corporation and its transfer agents and registrars against all loss, cost
and damage which may arise from issuance of a new certificate in place of
the original certificate; and (d) satisfies any other reasonable
requirements imposed by the corporation.  Approvals or any requirements
pursuant to this section by the corporation may be granted or imposed by
the President, and Vice-President, the Secretary, any Assistant
Secretary, or any other officer as authorized by the Board of Directors.

such sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in their
absolute discretion, think proper and for such purposes as the Board
shall think conducive to the interests of the corporation.

Section 2.  Finances.

     All funds of the corporation not otherwise employed shall be
deposited in its name in, and shall be subject to application or
withdrawal from, banks, trust companies or other depositories to be

as may be authorized by, or pursuant to the authority of, resolution of
the Board of Directors.  All checks, notes, drafts and other negotiable

was a director, officer, employee or agent of this corporation, or who is
or was serving at the request of this corporation as a director, officer,
trustee, employee or agent of any other enterprise, or the legal
representative of any such person, and who is or was a party to or
threatened to be made a party to any proceeding, civil, criminal or
otherwise in respect of any past, present or future matter, by reason of
the fact that such person is or was serving in any of the foregoing
capacities.  The determination as to whether an applicant has met the
standards to entitle him to indemnification shall be made by a Committee
of Directors, not less than three, appointed by the Board of Directors
for the purpose, none of whom shall be parties to the proceedings, or if
there are not at least three directors who are not parties to the
proceedings, or if there are three such directors and the Board so
directs, the determination shall be made in a written opinion by
independent legal counsel designated by the Board of Directors.  The
question of indemnification shall not be submitted to shareholders unless
so directed by the Board of Directors.

Directors at the time in office at any regular or special meeting of the
