ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company) is engaged primarily in developing, 
manufacturing, and marketing consumer and commercial imaging products.

In conjunction with the Company's announced intention to refocus its attention 
on its consumer and commercial imaging businesses, the Company has changed its 
segments for financial reporting purposes, effective with the second quarter 
of 1994.  The Consumer Imaging business unit, which was previously reported in 
the former Imaging segment, is now reported as a separate segment.  The new 
Commercial Imaging segment includes the other business units from the former 
Imaging segment, the business units from the former Information segment, 
Digital and Applied Imaging operations and the Health Sciences business unit, 
which was previously included in the Health segment.  Data for prior periods 
have been restated to conform with the 1994 presentation.

Kodak's sales, earnings and identifiable assets by industry segment for the 
past three years are shown in Segment Information on page 46.
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CONSUMER IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the consumer imaging segment, including intersegment sales, for the 
past three years were:

(in millions)                                      1994       1993       1992 

                                                 $5,919     $5,292     $5,414 

The products of the consumer imaging segment are used for capturing, recording 
or displaying a consumer originated image.  For example, traditional amateur 
photography requires, at a minimum, a camera, film, and photofinishing.  
Photofinishing requires equipment and supplies, including chemicals and paper 
for prints.

Kodak manufactures and markets various components of imaging systems.  For 
amateur photography, Kodak supplies films, photographic papers, processing 
services, photographic chemicals, cameras and projectors.  Recent imaging 
products developed by Kodak include new generations of films, cameras, 
photographic papers and single-use cameras.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's consumer imaging products and services are 
distributed worldwide through a variety of channels.  Individual products are 
often used in substantial quantities in more than one market.  Most sales of 
the consumer imaging segment are made through dealers.  Independent retail 
outlets handling Kodak amateur products total many thousands.  In a few areas 
abroad, Kodak products are marketed by independent national distributors.

Kodak's advertising programs actively promote its products and services in its 
various markets, and its principal trademarks, trade dress, and corporate 
symbol are widely used and recognized.

Kodak's consumer imaging products and services compete with similar products 
and services of others.  Competition in traditional imaging markets is strong 
throughout the world.  Many large and small companies offer similar products 
and services that compete with Kodak's business.  Kodak's products are 
continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its 
customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the consumer imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing.  Digital electronics 
are becoming more integral in product offerings.

COMMERCIAL IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the commercial imaging segment for the past three years were:

(in millions)                                     1994       1993       1992

                                                $7,646     $7,382     $7,592

The commercial imaging segment consists of businesses that serve the imaging 
and information needs of commercial customers.  Products in this segment are 
used to capture, store, process and display images and information in a 
variety of forms.

Kodak products for the commercial imaging segment include films, photographic 
papers, photographic plates, chemicals, processing equipment and audiovisual 
equipment, as well as copiers, graphic arts films, microfilm products, 
applications software, printers and other business equipment and service 
agreements to support these products.  These products serve professional 
photofinishers, professional photographers, customers in the healthcare 
industry, customers in motion picture, television, commercial printing and 
publishing, office automation and government markets.  Recent commercial 
imaging products developed by Kodak include commercial imaging applications 
for the recently introduced photo CD system.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's commercial imaging products and services 
are distributed through a variety of channels.  The Company also sells and 
leases business equipment directly to users.  Most sales of the commercial 
imaging segment, however, are made through dealers.

Kodak's commercial imaging products and services compete with similar products 
and services of other small and large companies.  Strong competition exists 
throughout the world.  Kodak's products are continually improved to meet the 
changing needs and preferences of its customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the commercial imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing.  Electronic components 
represent a significant portion of the cost of the materials used in the 
manufacture of business equipment.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - HEALTH BUSINESSES

On May 3, 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses:  the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division.  These businesses are reported as discontinued operations with 
results for prior periods restated.  At December 31, 1994, the Company had 
completed the sales of all of these businesses for aggregate gross proceeds of 
$7,858 million.  In addition, as part of the divestiture, the Company is 
actively negotiating with potential buyers for its pharmaceutical research and 
development facility and its NanoSystems unit, and anticipates completing 
these transactions in 1995.

Sales of products of these discontinued health businesses for the past three 
years were (1994 sales are through sales dates):

(in millions)                           1994       1993       1992   

                                      $3,175     $3,694     $3,553

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - CHEMICALS SEGMENT

On December 31, 1993, the Company distributed all of the outstanding shares of 
common stock of Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman), which represented 
substantially all of the Company's worldwide chemical business, as a dividend 
to the Company's shareowners (the spin-off) in a ratio of one share of Eastman 
common stock for every four shares of Kodak common stock.  As a result of the 
spin-off, Eastman became an independent publicly held company listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange and its operation ceased to be owned by the Company.  
In connection with the spin-off, Eastman assumed $1.8 billion of new 
borrowings, the proceeds from which were used by the Company to retire other 
borrowings.  The chemicals segment has been reported as discontinued 
operations and results for prior periods have been restated.

Sales of chemicals segment products, including intersegment sales, for the two 
years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 were:

(in millions)                          1993       1992

                                     $3,976     $3,927

- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Through the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in 
research and development.  In 1994, $859 million (1993 - $864 million; 1992 - 
$988 million) was expended for research and development in continuing 
operations.  Research and development groups for continuing operations are 
located principally in the United States in Rochester, New York; outside the 
U.S., research and development groups are located in England, France, Japan 
and Germany.  These groups, in close cooperation with manufacturing units and 
marketing organizations, are constantly developing new products and 
applications to serve both existing and new markets.

It has been Kodak's general practice to protect its investment in research and 
development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents where 
feasible.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to 
use its inventions but at the same time is accompanied by a liberal 
patent-licensing policy.  While in the aggregate Kodak's patents are 
considered to be of material importance in the operation of its business, it 
does not consider that the patents relating to any single product or process 
are of material significance when judged from the standpoint of its total 
business.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning 
environmental matters.  Some of the U.S. federal environmental legislation 
having an impact on Kodak includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act, and the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the 
Superfund law).

Kodak continues to engage in a program for environmental protection and 
control.  During 1994, expenditures for pollution prevention and waste 
treatment for continuing operations at various manufacturing facilities 
totaled $122 million.  These costs included $83 million of recurring costs 
associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in on-going 
operations, $36 million of capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous 
substances or pollutants, and $3 million of mandated expenditures to remediate 
previously contaminated sites.  These expenditures have been accounted for in 
accordance with the Company's accounting policy for environmental costs.  The 
Company expects these recurring and remediation costs to increase slightly and 
capital to increase significantly in the near future.  While these costs will 
continue to be significant cash outflows for the Company, it is not expected 
that these costs will have an impact materially different from 1994's 
environmental expenditures on the Company's financial position, results of 
operations, cash flows or competitive position.

In October 1994, the Company, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement of a civil complaint 
alleging noncompliance by the Company with federal environmental regulations 
at the Company's Kodak Park manufacturing site in Rochester, New York.  The 
Company paid a penalty of $5 million.  A Consent Decree was signed under which 
the Company is subject to a Compliance Schedule by which the Company will 
improve its waste characterization procedures, upgrade one of its incinerators 
and evaluate and upgrade its industrial sewer system over a 12-year period.  
The expenditures that may be required to complete this program cannot 
currently be reasonably estimated since upgrade plans have not been finalized 
and must be developed on an ongoing basis.  Further, most costs associated 
with the program will be for capital expenditures.

The Company has reviewed a RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining to the 
Company's Kodak Park site in Rochester, New York and has completed a 
broad-based assessment of the site in response to the RFA.  While future 
expenditures associated with any remediation activities could be significant, 
it is not possible to reasonably estimate those expenditures until remedial 
investigation and feasibility studies are performed.

The Company accrues for remediation costs that relate to an existing condition 
caused by past operations when it is probable that these costs will be 
incurred and can be reasonably estimated.  The Company has accrued for 
remediation costs of $108 million in its financial statements at December 31, 
1994, compared with $84 million at December 31, 1993.  

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  The Company may be 
required to incur significant costs, primarily capital in nature, over a 
period of several years to comply with the provisions of this Act.  The 
expenditures that may be required cannot be currently reasonably estimated 
since either implementing regulations have not been issued or compliance plans 
have not been finalized.

- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMPLOYMENT

At the end of 1994, the Company employed 96,300 people, of whom 54,300 were 
employed in the U.S.  The acquisition of Qualex during 1994 added 
approximately 7,600 people to the Company's U.S. employment.  Acquisitions 
outside the U.S. during 1994 added approximately 1,200 people to the Company's 
employment levels.  Approximately 5,100 personnel left the Company during 1994 
under restructuring programs.

Segment Information on page 45.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The consumer imaging segment of Kodak's business in the United States is 
centered in and near Rochester, New York, where photographic goods are 
manufactured.  Another manufacturing facility near Windsor, Colorado, also 
produces sensitized photographic goods.  Regional distribution centers are 
located in various places within the United States.

Consumer imaging manufacturing facilities outside the United States are 
located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  
Kodak maintains marketing and distribution facilities in many parts of the 
world.  The Company also owns processing laboratories in numerous locations 
worldwide.

Products in the commercial imaging segment are manufactured primarily in 
Rochester, New York and Windsor, Colorado.  Manufacturing facilities outside 
the United States are located in Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

The Company owns or leases administrative, manufacturing, marketing, and 
processing facilities in various parts of the world.  The leases are for 
various periods and are generally renewable.

The manufacturing and marketing facilities are adequate and suitable, in 
relation to prevailing conditions, to serve the needs of their marketing 
areas.

- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is participating in the EPA's Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) 
Section 8(e) Compliance Audit Program.  As a participant, the Company has 
agreed to audit its files for materials which under current EPA guidelines 
would be subject to notification under Section 8(e) of TSCA and to pay 
stipulated penalties for each report submitted under this program.  The 
Company anticipates that its liability under the program will be $1,000,000.

In addition to the foregoing environmental actions, the Company has been 
designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended 
(the Superfund law), or under similar state laws, for environmental assessment 
and cleanup costs as the result of the Company's alleged arrangements for 
disposal of hazardous substances at approximately twenty-five Superfund sites.  
With respect to each of these sites, the Company's actual or potential 
allocated share of responsibility is small.  Furthermore, numerous other PRPs 
have similarly been designated at these sites and, although the law imposes 
joint and several liability on PRPs, as a practical matter costs are shared 
with other PRPs.  Settlements and costs paid by the Company in Superfund 
matters to date have not been material.  Future costs are also not expected to 
be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits, claims, 
investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, commercial, 
environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being handled and 
defended in the ordinary course of business.  There are no such matters 
pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to be material in 
relation to the Company's business, financial condition, or results of 
operations.

     reduced net earnings by $353 million and after deducting $55 million of restructuring costs 
     from discontinued operations which reduced net earnings by $34 million.  The net loss for 
     1993 was due to an after-tax charge of $2.17 billion from the cumulative effect of adopting 
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 106, Employers' Accounting for

The Company's net earnings of $557 million for 1994 were significantly 
impacted by the divestiture of its non-imaging health businesses, a program to 
pay down a substantial portion of its debt and financial instruments, and 
restructuring costs.

On May 3, 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses:  the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division.  These businesses are reported as discontinued operations with 
results for prior periods restated.  Earnings from discontinued operations 
include allocations of interest and taxes to the health businesses.  At 
December 31, 1994, the Company had completed the sales of all of these 
businesses for aggregate gross proceeds of $7,858 million.  In addition, as 
part of the divestiture, the Company is actively negotiating with potential 
buyers for its pharmaceutical research and development facility and its 
NanoSystems unit, and anticipates completing these transactions in 1995.  The 
net gain on the sales of these businesses was $350 million or $1.03 per share.

The Company used $8,142 million from the divestiture, short-term borrowings and 
operations to extinguish $6,598 million (net carrying amount) of borrowings, 
$7,800 million (notional amount) of financial instruments, a $292 million 
master lease program and $200 million sale of receivables programs.  As a 
result of these actions, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of $266 
million after-tax ($.79 per share).  In addition, a $110 million pre-tax loss 
($80 million or $.24 per share after-tax) was recorded in "other costs" for 
these actions.

On August 12, 1994, the Company acquired the remaining shares of Qualex, a 
photofinisher operating primarily in the U.S.  Prior to that date, the Company 
had an investment in Qualex of approximately fifty percent of its outstanding 
common shares, which was accounted for under the equity method.  The Company 
purchased the remaining shares for $150 million with a combination of $50 
million cash paid at acquisition and a note.  At December 31, 1994, $100 
million remains to be paid in two equal installments in February and August 
1995.

Sales from continuing operations in 1994 were $13,557 million, an increase of 
seven percent over sales for 1993.  Excluding the sales of Qualex, sales from 
continuing operations increased five percent over a year ago.

Earnings from continuing operations of $554 million ($1.65 per share) for 1994 
were adversely impacted by restructuring costs of $340 million pre-tax ($254 
million or $.75 per share after-tax) in addition to the $110 million pre-tax 
loss ($80 million or $.24 per share after-tax) described above for the 
extinguishment of certain financial instruments.  Earnings from continuing 
operations of $644 million ($1.95 per share) in 1993 were significantly 
reduced by restructuring costs of $495 million pre-tax ($353 million or $1.08 
per share after-tax).  Earnings from continuing operations, before deducting 
the restructuring costs in both years and the charge for extinguishment of 
certain financial instruments in 1994, were down approximately $109 million in 
1994 when compared with 1993.  Earnings for 1994 were adversely impacted by 
premium costs associated with currency hedges, while earnings for 1993 
benefited from gains on currency hedges.  The benefits to 1994 earnings from 
continuing operations from higher volumes and manufacturing productivity were 
more than offset by the adverse effects of cost escalation, lower effective 
selling prices, incremental charges associated with the review of the carrying 
value of all assets, increased levels of marketing and administrative 
activity, smaller gains from the sales of investments and a higher effective 
tax rate.

On December 31, 1993, the Company distributed to its shareowners its worldwide 
chemical business, which consisted of Eastman Chemical Company operations.  
Results for Eastman Chemical Company operations are being reported as 
discontinued operations and results for prior periods have been restated.  
Earnings from discontinued operations include allocations of interest and 
taxes to the Chemicals segment and transaction costs associated with the 
spin-off.

The Company posted sales from continuing operations of $12,670 million in 
1993.  Earnings from continuing operations for 1993 were $644 million ($1.95 
per share) compared with earnings of $845 million ($2.60 per share) in 1992.  
Earnings from continuing operations were significantly reduced by 
restructuring costs in both years.  The restructuring costs for continuing 
operations were $495 million ($353 million or $1.08 per share after-tax) in 
1993 compared with $219 million ($140 million or $.43 per share after-tax) in 
1992.  Earnings from continuing operations, before deducting restructuring 
costs in both years, increased one percent in 1993 when compared with 1992.  
Earnings benefited from increased unit volumes, lower marketing and 
administrative activity, lower research and development activity, 
manufacturing productivity and lower interest expense; but were adversely 
affected by cost escalation, lower effective selling prices, higher retiree 
healthcare costs associated with the change in accounting for certain 
postretirement benefits, smaller gains from the sales of investments, and the 
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.  Earnings for 1993 
benefited from gains on currency hedges while earnings for 1992 were adversely 
impacted by premium costs associated with currency hedges.  Net earnings for 
1993 were reduced by an extraordinary charge of $14 million after-tax ($.04 per 
share) related to the early extinguishment of debt, while net earnings for 
1992 benefited by approximately $75 million after-tax ($.23 per share) from 
gains on the sales of investments, including the sale of Eastman Kodak Credit 
Corporation (EKCC).

Net earnings for 1993 benefited by $23 million ($.07 per share) from 
discontinued operations compared with a benefit of $149 million ($.46 per 
share) in 1992.  Earnings from discontinued operations for 1993 were lower 
when compared with 1992, as the benefits from higher unit volumes and higher 
effective selling prices were more than offset by cost escalation, higher 
retiree healthcare costs associated with the change in accounting for certain 
postretirement benefits, a provision for environmental costs, transaction 
costs associated with the spin-off of the Company's worldwide chemical 
business, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes, and 
restructuring costs of $55 million pre-tax ($34 million or $.10 per share 
after-tax).

The 1993 net loss was due to an after-tax charge of $2.17 billion ($6.60 per 
share) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and SFAS No. 112, Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits effective as of January 1, 1993.  Net 
earnings for 1992 benefited by $152 million ($.47 per share) from the adoption 
of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, effective as of January 1, 1992.

SALES

Worldwide sales from continuing operations in 1994 were up seven percent when 
compared with a year ago primarily due to higher unit volumes.  Sales for the 
Consumer Imaging segment increased significantly, while Commercial Imaging 
segment sales were up slightly.

Worldwide sales from continuing operations for 1993 were down two percent when 
compared with 1992, as slight increases in unit volumes were more than offset 
by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower 
effective selling prices.  The Consumer Imaging and Commercial Imaging 
segments both recorded a slight decline when compared with 1992.

In the Consumer Imaging segment, 1994 sales to customers inside the U.S. were 
up significantly over a year ago due to volume gains and the inclusion of 
revenues from Qualex, which was acquired in August of 1994.  Excluding sales 
of Qualex, sales to customers in the U.S. posted a moderate increase.  Sales 
to customers outside the U.S. in 1994 recorded good increases over 1993 as 
significant volume gains and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate 
changes were partially offset by lower effective selling prices.  Worldwide 
volume increases were led by Ektacolor papers, Kodacolor 35mm films and 
single-use cameras.

In the Consumer Imaging segment, sales to customers inside the U.S. in 1993 
were up one percent over sales for 1992, as slight increases in unit volumes 
were partially offset by lower effective selling prices.  Outside the U.S., 
sales decreased in 1993, as moderate increases in unit volumes were more than 
offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower 
effective selling prices.  Worldwide volume gains were led by Kodacolor 35mm 
films, single-use cameras and Ektacolor papers.  

In the Commercial Imaging segment, 1994 sales to customers in the U.S. were up 
one percent over a year ago as volume increases were partially offset by lower 
effective selling prices.  Sales to customers outside the U.S. in 1994 
increased moderately over a year ago as moderate volume gains and the 
favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes were partially offset by 
lower effective selling prices.  Worldwide sales increases were led by 
printing and professional imaging, motion picture and television imaging, and 
health sciences products.

In the Commercial Imaging segment, 1993 sales comparisons with 1992 for 
customers in the U.S. and outside the U.S. were adversely affected by lower 
effective selling prices and the inclusion in 1992 of revenues from divested 
units.  In addition, outside the U.S., volume increases for continuing 
businesses were more than offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign 
currency rate changes.

EARNINGS

Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Consumer Imaging and 
Commercial Imaging segments were adversely affected by restructuring costs of 
$340 million in 1994, $495 million in 1993 and $219 million in 1992.  The 1994 
restructuring costs represent severance and other termination benefits for 
approximately 4,350 personnel and exit costs related to the realignment of 
Kodak's worldwide manufacturing, marketing, administrative and photofinishing 
operations.  The 1993 restructuring costs represent the cost of separation 
benefits for a cost reduction program expected to reduce worldwide employment 
by approximately 9,000 personnel and the cost of closing a facility in Germany 
that manufactured a component for the Company's ink jet printing business.  
The restructuring costs in 1992 included costs of an early retirement plan, 
the restructuring of non-U.S. sensitized manufacturing and photofinishing 
operations, and the Company's exit from non-strategic businesses.

Operating earnings from continuing operations for the Consumer Imaging and 
Commercial Imaging segments for 1994 and 1993 were adversely impacted, when 
compared with 1992 earnings, by higher retiree healthcare costs associated 
with the change in accounting for certain postretirement benefits effective 
January 1, 1993.

Consumer Imaging segment operating earnings were adversely affected by 
restructuring costs in 1994, 1993 and 1992 of $190 million, $141 million and 
$58 million, respectively.  Operating earnings for 1994 were essentially level 
with 1993, before deducting restructuring costs in both years.  Earnings for 
1994 benefited from higher volumes and manufacturing productivity, but were 
adversely affected by higher levels of marketing and administrative activity, 
cost escalation and lower effective selling prices.  In addition, 1994 
earnings were reduced by premium costs associated with strategic currency 
hedges, while 1993 earnings benefited from gains on strategic currency hedges.  
Operating earnings decreased in 1993 when compared with 1992, before deducting 
restructuring costs in both years, as the benefits from increased unit 
volumes, lower marketing and administrative activity and manufacturing 
productivity were more than offset by lower effective selling prices, cost 
escalation and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.  
Earnings for 1993 benefited from gains on strategic currency hedges while 
earnings for 1992 were adversely impacted by premium costs associated with 
strategic currency hedges.

The Commercial Imaging segment operating earnings were adversely affected by 
restructuring costs in 1994, 1993 and 1992 of $150 million, $354 million and 
$161 million, respectively.  Operating earnings for 1994 were lower when 
compared to 1993, before deducting restructuring costs in both years, as the 
benefits from manufacturing productivity, higher volumes and lower research 
and development activity were more than offset by cost escalation and lower 
effective selling prices.  In addition, earnings for 1994 were reduced by 
premium costs associated with strategic currency hedges, while 1993 earnings 
included gains from strategic currency hedges.  Operating earnings improved 
sharply in 1993 when compared with 1992, before deducting restructuring costs 
in both years, as the benefits from manufacturing productivity, lower 
marketing and administrative activity and lower research and development 
activity were only partially offset by cost escalation, the unfavorable 
effects of foreign currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.  
Earnings for 1993 benefited from gains on strategic currency hedges, while 
earnings for 1992 were adversely affected by premium costs associated with 
strategic currency hedges.

Research and development expenditures for continuing operations amounted to 
$859 million in 1994, compared with $864 million in 1993 and $988 million in 
1992.  Research and development expenditures in 1994 were essentially level 
with 1993 as cost escalation offset the benefits of lower activity levels.  
Research and development expenditures in 1993 were significantly below 1992 as 
the benefits from lower activity levels were only partially offset by cost 
escalation.  Amortization of goodwill for continuing operations amounted to 
$47 million in 1994, $29 million in 1993 and $23 million in 1992.  The increase 
in amortization in 1994 was primarily due to the acquisition of Qualex.  
Advertising and sales promotion expenses for continuing operations were 
$744 million in 1994, $646 million in 1993 and $725 million in 1992.  Other 
marketing and administrative expenses for continuing operations totaled 
$2,967 million in 1994, $2,774 million in 1993 and $3,000 million in 1992.  
Increases in advertising and sales promotion, and other marketing and 
administrative expenses in 1994 resulted from cost escalation, higher activity 
levels, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes and the 
acquisition of Qualex.  Decreases in advertising and sales promotion, and 
other marketing and administrative expenses in 1993 when compared with 1992 
resulted from the benefit of lower activity levels and the favorable effects 
of foreign currency rate changes, partially offset by cost escalation.  

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues were $130 million in 1994, 
$203 million in 1993 and $342 million in 1992.  The amounts for 1993 were 
higher than 1994 due to larger gains from the sales of investments and other 
items in 1993.  The results for 1992 were higher than 1994 and 1993 due to 
larger gains from the sales of investments in 1992, including the sale of 
EKCC.  

Interest expense of $142 million in 1994 was lower than the $175 million 
incurred in 1993 primarily due to lower levels of borrowings.  Interest 
expense in 1993 was lower than the  $247 million incurred in 1992 as a result 
of lower effective interest rates.  Interest expense of approximately 
$390 million in 1994 and $586 million in 1993 and 1992, and capitalized 
interest of approximately $7 million in 1994 and $51 million in 1993 and 1992 
were allocated to discontinued operations.

The increase in other costs in 1994 when compared with 1993 is primarily due 
to the inclusion in 1994 of $110 million of charges associated with the 
extinguishment of certain financial instruments.  The increase in other costs 
in 1993 when compared with 1992 is primarily due to higher net losses in 1993 
from foreign exchange transactions and the translation of net monetary items 
in highly inflationary economies.

The Company has a program in place to manage foreign currency risk.  The 
Company currently uses foreign currency option contracts to hedge its exposure 
to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for anticipated sales and 
purchases for certain foreign affiliates and probable anticipated export 
sales.  Currency changes against the U.S. dollar favorably affected 1994 sales 
from continuing operations by $135 million and unfavorably affected 1993 sales 
from continuing operations by $490 million.  These effects were partially 
offset by premium costs of $86 million and gains of $73 million from strategic 
currency hedges in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The Company has also entered 
into foreign currency contracts to hedge a portion of its transactions in 
foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.  The effect of these 
hedges and the gains and losses on transaction exposures was a loss of $46 
million in 1994, a loss of $44 million in 1993 and a gain of $40 million in 
1992.

The effective tax rates for continuing operations were 44.7% in 1994, 40.2% in 
1993 and 38.7% in 1992.  The higher rates in 1994 and 1993 are primarily due 
to higher operating losses and restructuring costs in jurisdictions outside 
the U.S. for which tax benefits cannot be taken.

CASH DIVIDENDS

Total cash dividends of approximately $537 million ($.40 per share each 
quarter), $657 million ($.50 per share each quarter) and $650 million ($.50 per 
share each quarter) were declared in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The lower dividends in 1994 were due to the spin-off of the Eastman Chemical 
Company operations at year-end 1993.  As a result of the spin-off, the 
Company's shareowners received one share of Eastman Chemical Company stock for 
every four shares of Kodak common stock.
 
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINANCIAL POSITION

Cash and cash equivalents increased to $2,020 million at year-end 1994 from 
$1,635 million at year-end 1993.  In connection with the spin-off of the 
worldwide chemical business at year-end 1993, the Company borrowed 
$1,800 million in December 1993, which subsequently was assumed by the 
worldwide chemical business on December 31, 1993.  The proceeds from the 
borrowings, which were retained by Kodak, were used to retire other borrowings 
in 1994.  

Cash and cash equivalents at year-end 1994 included a $1,550 million note 
received on December 31, 1994 when the Company completed the sale of its 
household products business of L&F Products.  The note was paid in cash to the 
Company on January 3, 1995.  The cash and cash equivalents at year-end 1994 is 
expected to be used in 1995 by the Company to pay taxes associated with the 
divestiture of the non-imaging health businesses and for normal operations.  

The Company used $8,142 million from the divestiture, short-term borrowings and 
operations to extinguish $6,598 million (net carrying amount) of borrowings, 
$7,800 million (notional amount) of financial instruments, a $292 million 
master lease program and $200 million sale of receivables programs.

Approximately one-third of the restructuring costs recorded by the Company in 
1994 is for separation benefits for approximately 4,350 personnel leaving the 
Company.  Most of these benefits will be paid during 1995 from operating cash 
flows.  Approximately $40 million represents future cash payments to be made 
over several years for noncancelable leases.  The remainder of the 1994 
restructuring costs represents the non-cash write-offs of assets for facility 
closures and business exits, most of which will be completed during 1995.  
After-tax savings from the 1994 restructuring program are expected to be 
approximately $100 million in 1995 and $125 million annually beginning in 1996 
as a result of lower costs for salaries, benefits, depreciation and leasing.  
Approximately three-fourths of the restructuring costs recorded by the Company 
in 1993 represented the cost of separation benefits for personnel leaving 
under a workforce reduction program.  Most of these benefits were paid during 
1993 and 1994 from operating cash flows.  The remainder of the 1993 
restructuring costs were associated with the closure of a facility in Germany, 
which was completed in 1994.  Approximately $40 million of these costs is for 
separation benefits to be paid to former employees over several years.  The 
remainder of the costs represents the non-cash write-offs of assets associated 
with the facility closure.  An analysis of restructuring costs for the last 
three years is provided in the Restructuring Costs note on pages 38 and 39.

The Company has access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in 
May, 1999.  The Company also has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 
for debt securities with an available balance of $2.2 billion.

Projected operating cash flows are expected to be adequate to support normal 
business operations, planned capital expenditures and dividend payments in 
1995.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

During 1994, expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment for 
continuing operations at various manufacturing facilities totaled $122 million.
These costs included $83 million of recurring costs associated with managing
hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations, $36 million of capital
expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances or pollutants, and
$3 million of mandated expenditures to remediate previously contaminated sites.
The Company expects these recurring and remediation costs to increase slightly
and capital to increase significantly in the near future.  While these costs
will continue to be significant cash outflows for the Company, it is not
expected that these costs will have an impact materially different from 1994's
environmental expenditures on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

In October 1994, the Company, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement of a civil complaint 
alleging noncompliance by the Company with federal environmental regulations 
at the Company's Kodak Park manufacturing site in Rochester, New York.  The 
Company paid a penalty of $5 million.  A Consent Decree was signed under which 
the Company is subject to a Compliance Schedule by which the Company will 
improve its waste characterization procedures, upgrade one of its incinerators 
and evaluate and upgrade its industrial sewer system over a 12-year period.  
The expenditures that may be required to complete this program cannot 
currently be reasonably estimated since upgrade plans have not been finalized 
and must be developed on an ongoing basis.  Further, most costs associated 
with the program will be for capital expenditures.

The Company has reviewed a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) 
Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining to the Company's Kodak Park site in 
Rochester, New York and has completed a broad-based assessment of the site in 
response to the RFA.  While future expenditures associated with any 
remediation activities could be significant, it is not possible to reasonably 
estimate those expenditures until remedial investigation and feasibility 
studies are performed.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  The Company may be 
required to incur significant costs, primarily capital in nature, over a 
period of several years to comply with the provisions of this Act.  The 
expenditures that may be required cannot currently be reasonably estimated 
since either implementing regulations have not been issued or compliance plans 
have not been finalized.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the 
consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear on pages 19 
through 48.  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles and of necessity include some amounts 
that are based on management's best estimates and judgments.
  The Company's accounting systems include extensive internal controls 
designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial 
records and the proper safeguarding and use of its assets.  Such controls are 
based on established policies and procedures, are implemented by trained, 
skilled personnel with an appropriate segregation of duties, and are monitored 
through a comprehensive internal audit program.  The Company's policies and 
procedures prescribe that the Company and all employees are to maintain the 
highest ethical standards and that its business practices throughout the world 
are to be conducted in a manner which is above reproach.
  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Price Waterhouse 
LLP, independent accountants, who were responsible for conducting their audits 
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Their resulting 
report is shown below.
  The Board of Directors exercises its responsibility for these financial 
statements through its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of 
non-management Board members.  The independent accountants and internal 
auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee.  The Audit 
Committee meets periodically with the independent accountants and the Director 
of Corporate Auditing of the Company, both privately and with management 
present, to discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of
Eastman Kodak Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in 
the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 63 of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Eastman Kodak Company and subsidiary companies at December 31, 
1994 and 1993, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are 
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We 
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, 
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in the Nonpension Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits 
note, the Company changed its method of accounting for certain postretirement 
benefits and other postemployment benefits in 1993.  As discussed in the 
Income Taxes note, the Company changed its method of accounting for income 
taxes in 1992.

Eastman Kodak Company and Subsidiary Companies
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman Kodak 
Company and its majority owned subsidiary companies (the Company).  
Intercompany transactions are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the 
portion of the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to minority interests.  

FOREIGN CURRENCY 

For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is the 
functional currency and translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate 
component of shareowners' equity.

For subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic 
environment is highly inflationary, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency 
and gains and losses that result from translation are included in earnings.  
The losses from translation were $7 million in 1994, $10 million in 1993 and 
$31 million in 1992.

The Company hedges certain foreign currency transactions, firm foreign 
currency commitments, anticipated sales and purchases for certain foreign 
affiliates and probable anticipated export sales by entering into forward 
exchange contracts and currency options.  Gains and losses associated with 
currency rate changes on forward contracts hedging foreign currency 
transactions are recorded currently in earnings.  The effect from foreign 
currency transactions, including related hedging activities, was a loss of 
$46 million in 1994, a loss of $44 million in 1993 and a gain of $40 million in 
1992.  Gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments or probable 
anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized in earnings or as 
adjustments of carrying amounts when the transaction occurs.  

CASH EQUIVALENTS

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or 
less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.  At December 
31, 1994, included in "cash and cash equivalents" is a $1,550 million note 
received in connection with the sale of the household products business which 
had a maturity of four days.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of market.  The cost of 
most inventories in the U.S. is determined by the "last-in, first-out" (LIFO) 
method.  The cost of other inventories is determined by the "first-in, 
first-out" (FIFO), or average cost method.


PROPERTIES

Properties are recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation.  When 
assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost of such assets and the 
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Company's accounts and 
any profit or loss is reflected in earnings.  Depreciation expense is provided 
based on historical cost and estimated useful lives.  The Company generally 
uses the straight-line method for calculating the provision for depreciation.  

GOODWILL

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period 
estimated to be benefited, not exceeding fifteen years for continuing 
operations.  The Company regularly assesses the recoverability of unamortized 
amounts of goodwill utilizing relevant cash flow and profitability 
information.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND JOINT VENTURES

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, 
Accounting For Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which was 
adopted on January 1, 1994, the Company has classified applicable investments 
into the categories of "available-for-sale" and "held-to-maturity".  The 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's 
results of operations or financial position.  Investments classified as 
"available-for-sale" or as "held-to-maturity" are included in either 
"marketable securities" or "long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets" 
based on the maturity date of the investment.

Included in "long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets" are 
investments which are managed as integral parts of the Company's segment 
operations and are accounted for on an equity basis.  The Company's share of 
the earnings of these joint ventures is included in consolidated revenues and 
in earnings from operations for the related segments.

REVENUE

Revenue is recognized from film and equipment sales (including sales-type 
leases for equipment) when the product is shipped; from maintenance and 
service contracts over the contractual period, or as the services are 
performed; from rentals under operating leases in the month in which they are 
realized; and from financing transactions at level rates of return over the 
term of the lease or receivable.

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in "marketing and 
administrative expenses".  Advertising expenses amounted to $744 million, 
$646 million and $725 million for 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or 
capitalized, as appropriate.  Remediation costs that relate to an existing 
condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these 
costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated.

NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

Postemployment benefits for former or inactive employees, excluding retirement 
benefits, are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 112, Employers' 
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, effective January 1, 1993.  
Thereafter, the cost of benefits (principally long-term disability coverage 
and certain severance benefits) are accrued over an employee's service life.

Postretirement benefits other than pensions (principally healthcare and life 
insurance) are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, effective January 
1, 1993.  Thereafter, the estimated cost of retiree benefit payments is 
accrued during an employee's active service life.  Prior to January 1, 1993, 
the Company expensed the cost of these benefits on a "pay-as-you-go" basis.  
Prior service costs resulting from amendments to postretirement healthcare 
plans are amortized over the average remaining service period to full 
eligibility of the active employees.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes.  
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the 
amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes 
and such amounts recognized for tax purposes.  Deferred taxes are measured by 
applying currently enacted tax laws.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Primary earnings per share are computed on the basis of the weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding.  Fully diluted earnings per share assume 
the conversion of convertible debentures (with an increase in net income for 
the after-tax interest savings) and the issuance of common stock related to 
stock options.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications of 1993 and 1992 financial statement and related 
footnote amounts have been made to conform with the 1994 presentation.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In May 1994, the Company announced its intent to divest the following 
non-imaging health businesses:  the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division.  These businesses are reported as discontinued operations.  
Accordingly, the financial statement information for 1993 and 1992 related to 
these businesses has been presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position as "net assets of discontinued operations", and in the "discontinued 
operations" line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The noncurrent 
asset classification is consistent with the Company's use of most of the 
proceeds to reduce long-term borrowings.  Prior periods also include the 
allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations by reference to the 
interest expense on indebtedness repaid from the net sales proceeds.

On various dates during the fourth quarter of 1994, the Company consummated 
transactions divesting these businesses.  The total cash or cash equivalent 
proceeds from the sales amounted to $7,858 million as follows:  pharmaceutical 
business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. $1,675 million in cash; consumer health 
business of Sterling Winthrop Inc. $2,925 million in cash; household products 
business of L&F Products, a $1,550 million note received on December 31, 1994,
and paid in cash on January 3, 1995; do-it-yourself products business of L&F
Products $700 million in cash; Clinical Diagnostics Division $1,008 million in
cash.  In addition, the Company is actively negotiating with potential buyers
for its pharmaceutical research and development facility and its NanoSystems
unit and anticipates completing these transactions in 1995.

Amounts related to the remaining assets held for sale at December 31, 1994, 
are recorded at their net realizable value, and included in "other" current 
assets.  Liabilities retained and related to the businesses sold amounted to 
approximately $2,137 million at December 31, 1994.  These liabilities include 
"payables" of $296 million and "taxes-income and other" of $1,530 million in 
current liabilities and $311 million of "other long-term liabilities".

In the first half of 1994, the discontinued health businesses recorded sales 
of $1,800 million, loss before income taxes of $84 million (including 
approximately $230 million of allocated interest expense), benefit for income 
taxes of $3 million, and an after-tax loss of $81 million.  

In the second half of 1994, the "phase-out period", the following financial 
data was recorded:

*Including approximately $163 million of allocated interest expense.

The 1994 effective tax rate for discontinued health businesses was 85%.  The 
rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35% due to the 
required form of the consumer health business divestiture.  The stock sale of 
this business resulted in a significant tax loss for which no benefit was 
allowed in accordance with IRS regulations.

Summarized results of the discontinued health businesses for 1993 and 1992 are 
as follows:

The effective tax rates for discontinued health businesses were 24% and 27% 
for 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The rates differ from the applicable U.S. 
federal statutory income tax rates primarily due to the allocation of tax 
effects of non-deductible goodwill to discontinued operations.

Net assets of the discontinued health businesses at December 31, 1993 are 
comprised of the following:

In June 1993, the Company announced a plan to spin-off its Eastman Chemical 
Company operations, which was completed in December 1993.  Summarized results 
of the chemicals segment for 1993 and 1992 including allocations of interest 
expense, taxes and transaction costs associated with the spin-off are as 
follows:

                                     ======      ======      

The effective tax rates for discontinued chemicals operations were 28% and 30% 
in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The rates differ from the applicable U.S. 
federal statutory income tax rates primarily due to the allocation of foreign 
and state tax benefits to discontinued chemicals operations.

spin-off was a non-cash transaction and is also not reflected in the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

"marketable securities" and $103 million "long-term receivables and other 
noncurrent assets".  Available-for-sale securities consist of $27 million of 
"marketable securities".

During 1994, proceeds from the sale of available-for-sale securities were $249 
million.  An
$8 million loss was realized from the sale of these securities, using specific 
identification to determine the cost of securities sold.

Marketable securities (principally U.S. government securities and time 
deposits with commercial financial institutions) presented at December 31, 
1993, are shown at cost which approximates market value.

uncollectible receivables.  There are no significant concentrations of credit 
risk for receivables.

The Company terminated two agreements to sell undivided interests in trade 
accounts receivable during 1994 for approximately $200 million.

</TABLE>

Annual maturities (in millions) of long-term borrowings outstanding at 
December 31, 1994, are as follows:  1995: $0; 1996: $0; 1997: $245; 1998: $0; 
1999: $78; 2000 and beyond: $337.

Over the past several years, the Company had a program in place to manage 
interest rates related to its long-term borrowings portfolio.  In connection 
with this program, the Company utilized various interest rate derivatives in 
order to achieve an acceptable overall interest rate on its portfolio of 
long-term borrowings.  During 1994, and in connection with the Company's debt 
paydown program described below, all interest rate derivatives held in the 
Company's portfolio were extinguished.

In 1994, the Company tendered, defeased and called a total of $6,043 million 
(net carrying amount) of long-term borrowings and extinguished approximately 
$7,800 million (notional amount) of derivatives.  The cash paid to the holders 
of long-term borrowings and derivatives over the respective net carrying 
amounts of such instruments was recorded as an extraordinary loss of $266 
million after-tax ($367 million pre-tax) on the early extinguishment of debt.  
The effective tax rate for the extraordinary loss of 27% was unfavorably 
affected by the allocation of foreign tax credit impacts.  In addition to the 
extraordinary loss, a $110 million pre-tax loss was recorded in "other costs" 
for certain financial instruments related to other programs.

The total net carrying amount of all derivatives and long-term borrowings 
extinguished in 1994 amounted to approximately $6,725 million; certain amounts 
were previously recorded as "long-term borrowings" and "other long-term 
liabilities".

The cash paid to counterparties to extinguish the Company's derivative 
obligations and for related transaction costs amounted to $921 million.  The 
tender offer resulted in $2,901 million of cash being paid to debt holders and 
for related transaction costs.  

The in-substance defeasance was achieved by purchasing investment instruments 
under an arrangement consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 76, 
Extinguishment of Debt.  The Company believes that the investments placed in 
the defeasance trust will be sufficient to satisfy all future debt service 
requirements for the defeased debt instruments.  The total cash paid for the 
investments placed in the defeasance trust, including transaction costs, 
amounted to $1,692 million.

The debentures and notes that were called by the Company resulted in a 
combination of approximately 8.3 million shares (6.3 million common shares and 
2 million treasury shares) of the Company's common stock being issued (an 
increase of $353 million in common stock and additional capital paid in) and 
$1,349 million in cash being paid to debenture holders.

The extraordinary loss recorded in 1993 was the result of the early 
extinguishment of the 8 5/8% debentures due 2016 and zero coupon exchangeable 
senior debentures due 2006.

The Company has a $2,500 million unused revolving credit facility established 
in 1994 and expiring in May, 1999 which is available to support the Company's 
commercial paper borrowings.  If unused, it has a commitment fee of 
$2.5 million per year.  Interest on amounts borrowed under this facility is at 
rates based on spreads above certain reference rates.  The Company also has a 
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for debt securities with an available 
balance of $2.2 billion.

At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company's accrual for environmental 
remediation costs amounted to $108 million and $84 million, respectively.

In October 1994, the Company, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement of a civil complaint 
alleging noncompliance by the Company with federal environmental regulations 
at the Company's Kodak Park manufacturing site in Rochester, New York.  The 
Company paid a penalty of $5 million.  A Consent Decree was signed under which 
the Company is subject to a Compliance Schedule by which the Company will 
improve its waste characterization procedures, upgrade one of its incinerators 
and evaluate and upgrade its industrial sewer system over a 12-year period.  
The expenditures that may be required to complete this program cannot 
currently be reasonably estimated since upgrade plans have not been finalized 
and must be developed on an ongoing basis.  Further, most costs associated 
with the program will be for capital expenditures.

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under 
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980, as amended (the Superfund law), or under similar state laws, for 
environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the Company's 
alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at approximately 
twenty-five Superfund sites.  With respect to each of these sites, the 
Company's actual or potential allocated share of responsibility is small.  
Furthermore, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated at these sites 
and, although the law imposes joint and several liability on PRPs, as a 
practical matter, costs are shared with other PRPs.  Settlements and costs 
paid by the Company in Superfund matters to date have not been material.  
Future costs are also not expected to be material to the Company's financial 
condition or results of operations.

In addition to the foregoing environmental actions, the Company has reviewed a 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Assessment (RFA) 
pertaining to the Kodak Park site in Rochester, N.Y. and has completed a 
broad-based assessment of the site in response to the RFA.  While future 
expenditures associated with any remediation activities could be significant, 
it is not possible to reasonably estimate those expenditures until remedial 
investigation and feasibility studies are performed.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  The Company may be 
required to incur significant costs, primarily capital in nature, over a 
period of several years to comply with the provisions of this Act.  The 
expenditures that may be required cannot currently be reasonably estimated 
since either implementing regulations have not been issued or compliance plans 
have not been finalized.

The Company has retained certain obligations for environmental remediation 
matters related to non-imaging health businesses sold in 1994.  Actions to 
fulfill these obligations are not expected to be completed in the near term 
and costs related to the obligations are included in remediation accruals 
recorded at December 31, 1994.

The Company has entered into agreements with several companies to provide the 
Company with products and services to be used in its normal operations.  The 
minimum payments for these agreements are approximately $131 million in 1995, 
$120 million in 1996, $121 million in 1997, $113 million in 1998, $169 million
in 1999 and $14 million in 2000 and thereafter.

The Company has also guaranteed debt and other obligations under agreements 
with certain affiliated companies and customers.  At December 31, 1994, these 
guarantees totaled approximately $252 million.  The Company does not expect 
that these guarantees will have a material impact on the Company's future 
financial position or results of operations.

The Company has issued letters of credit in lieu of making security deposits 
to insure the payment of possible Workers' Compensation claims.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits, claims, 
investigations and proceedings, including product liability, commercial, 
environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being handled and 
defended in the ordinary course of business.  There are no such matters 
pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to be material in 
relation to the Company's business, financial condition or results of 
operations.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following table presents the carrying amounts and the estimated fair 
values of financial instruments at December 31, 1994 and 1993; ( ) denotes

The fair values of long-term borrowings were determined by reference to quoted 
market prices or by obtaining quotes from dealers.  Marketable securities and 
other investments are valued at quoted market prices, except for $66 million 
and $81 million of equity investments included in other investments at December 
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively, which are reflected at their carrying value 
because it is not practical to estimate fair value as quoted market prices do 
not exist.  The fair values for the remaining financial instuments in the 
above table are based on dealer quotes and reflect the estimated amounts the 
Company would pay or receive to terminate the contracts.  The carrying value 
of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short-term borrowings, and payables 
approximate their fair values.

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financial activities, is 
exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which 
may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.  In 
seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities, 
the Company manages exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities and, 
when deemed appropriate, through the use of financial instruments.  The 
instruments utilized include forward, option and swap agreements.  The Company 
does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative 
purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments.

Furthermore, during 1994 and in connection with the Company's debt paydown 
program, all interest rate financial instruments were extinguished.  

The Company's exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises 
from intercompany loans utilized to finance foreign subsidiaries, receivables, 
payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions.  The 
Company attempts to hedge all such transaction exposures with internal natural 
offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been 
exhausted, through forward and swap agreements with third parties.  The 
Company currently also uses foreign currency option contracts to hedge its 
exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for anticipated sales 
and purchases for certain foreign affiliates and probable anticipated export 
sales.  All of the Company's foreign currency forward and option agreements 
outstanding at December 31, 1994, will mature throughout 1995.  In connection 
with a long-term intercompany loan to a Japanese affiliate, the Company has 
entered into a currency swap contract to purchase Japanese yen with a contract 
value of $135 million to be settled in 1997.

Gains and losses related to effective hedges, including hedges of anticipated 
transactions, are recognized in income as part of, and concurrent with, the 
hedged transaction.  The net unrealized loss deferred on such options as of 
December 31, 1994 totaled $50 million compared with a net unrealized loss of 
$69 million in 1993.  These amounts represent the gain or loss that would have 
been recognized had these options been liquidated at market value in their 
respective years.

The table below summarizes by major currency the notional amounts of foreign 
currency forward and option contracts in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currency 
amounts are translated at rates current at the reporting date.  The "buy" 
amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase 
foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S. dollar 
equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies.

The Company's financial instrument counterparties are substantial investment 
or commercial banks with significant experience with such instruments.  The 
Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum 
credit standards and diversification of counterparties.  The Company has 
procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts.  While the maximum credit 
exposure at December 31, 1994 is approximately $100 million, the Company 
believes that its actual credit risk, in part because of the above practices 
and procedures, is significantly less.

INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, Accounting for 
Income Taxes.  The adoption of this standard changed the Company's method of 
accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method.  
The cumulative effect of adopting the standard as of January 1, 1992, was a 
$100 million credit to earnings from continuing operations and a $52 million 
credit to earnings from discontinued operations.  

The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and 
the related provision (benefit) for U.S. and other income taxes were as 
follows:

The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to certain net operating 
loss carryforwards outside the U.S.  A majority of the net operating loss 
carryforwards are available indefinitely.

Retained earnings of subsidiary companies outside the U.S. were approximately 
$1,810 million and $2,402 million at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  
Retained earnings at December 31, 1994 are considered to be reinvested 
indefinitely.  If remitted, they would be substantially free of additional 
tax.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for 
temporary differences related to these retained earnings.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS

In December 1994, the Company committed to implement a restructuring program 
and recorded a fourth quarter provision of $340 million pre-tax ($254 million 
after-tax) for severance and other termination benefits and exit costs related 
to the realignment of the Company's worldwide manufacturing, marketing, 
administrative and photofinishing operations.

Severance actions included in the restructuring provision represent capacity 
reductions in manufacturing facilities and the consolidation of photofinishing 
operations and marketing and administrative functions in various locations of 
the Company's worldwide operations.  This program will result in a worldwide 
headcount reduction of approximately 4,350 employees.  The following table 
summarizes, by function, the number of terminations involved in the headcount 
reduction program:

                             ======        ======        ======

While most terminations will be completed by the end of 1995, the remaining 
terminations are expected to be completed by June 30, 1996.  In 1994, 115 
people were terminated in conjunction with this restructuring program at a 
cost of approximately $7 million.

The activities expected to be discontinued in conjunction with the realignment 
strategy include manufacturing and product assembly operations in certain 
locations, marketing presence in various parts of the world and photofinishing 
operations in certain locations.  Exit costs of $23 million were incurred in 
1994 related to this restructuring program.  

The Company recorded restructuring costs in 1993 for continuing operations of 
$495 million.  Approximately $350 million was provided for severance and 
termination benefit costs related to a cost reduction program to reduce 
worldwide employment by approximately 9,000 personnel.  By the end of 1994, 
approximately 7,500 personnel had been terminated with $120 million and 
$100 million being paid in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The remaining 1,500 
personnel are expected to be terminated by June 30, 1995.  The remainder of 
the 1993 restructuring provision related to exit and severance costs 
associated with the closure of a German manufacturing facility.  The costs 
charged to the reserve in 1994 amounted to approximately $47 million.  The 
remaining accrual balance at December 31, 1994 will provide for severance and 
pension payments to be paid over several years to former employees of the 
facility.

The Company recorded restructuring costs in 1992 for continuing operations of 
$219 million.  Approximately $150 million was provided for an early retirement 
program.  Most of the costs associated with this program are being funded from 
the Company's pension plan assets.  Accordingly, the remaining liability for 
these payments is reflected in the pension plan's benefit obligation.  
Consequently, the Company's cash flow has not been impacted by this liability, 
except to the extent of contributions made to the pension plan trust fund by 
the Company, of which there were no contributions in the past three years.  
The remainder of the costs provided in 1992 related primarily to a program to 
exit several non-strategic businesses and the restructuring of the Company's 
non-U.S. sensitized manufacturing and photofinishing businesses.  

The following table summarizes the Company's restructuring activities for the 
last three years:

which exceeded management's original estimates and relates primarily to properties associated 
with business exits and plant closures.  The 1994 provision for severance and related costs 
has been reduced by $50 million of 1993 severance reserves determined to be excess.

RETIREMENT PLANS

Substantially all U.S. employees are covered by a noncontributory plan, the 
Kodak Retirement Income Plan (KRIP), which is funded by Company contributions 
to an irrevocable trust fund.  Assets in the fund are held for the sole 
benefit of retired employees.  Periodically, the Company makes contributions 
to the KRIP trust fund as permitted by law.  Retirement benefits earned by 
employees prior to January 1, 1996, are based on a point system (age plus 
years of service).  Full, unreduced benefits are provided to individuals with 
85 points.  Participants with 75 or more points (or age 55 with 10 years of 
service) can retire with a reduced benefit.  Retirement benefits earned by 
employees subsequent to December 31, 1995, will no longer be based on the 
75/85 point system.  Full, unreduced benefits will be provided to individuals 
who are age 60 and have 30 years of service.  The minimum retirement age under 
the new plan is 55 years.  The benefit formula used to calculate the actual 
benefit dollars paid to an individual once retired will not change as a result 
of these new plan provisions.  This amendment to the pension plan was 
instituted by the Company July 1, 1994.  Retirement benefits generally become 
vested upon the completion of five years of service.  The assets of the trust 
fund are comprised of corporate equity and debt securities, U.S. government 
securities, partnership and joint venture investments, interests in pooled 
funds, and various types of interest rate and foreign currency financial 
instruments.

Continuing operations total pension expense for all plans included the

The benefit obligations for KRIP include amounts for employees who retired 
from Eastman Chemical Company (ECC) on or before December 31, 1993, the date 
ECC was spun-off from the Company.  Benefit obligations of all other ECC 
employees were transferred to ECC as part of the spin-off agreement.  The 
benefit obligation of KRIP excludes amounts for all employees (both retired 
and active) of the non-imaging health businesses sold in 1994 because those 
obligations were transferred to the buyers of the non-imaging health 
businesses.  The market value of assets of KRIP reflect the Company's 
estimates of the assets held for employees in continuing operations only.  The 
transfer of assets from the KRIP trust fund to ECC and the buyers of the 
non-imaging health businesses was not completed as of December 31, 1994.  The 
Company anticipates the transfer of assets will not be completed for several 
years to ensure compliance with agreements and applicable government 
regulations.

The assumptions used to compute pension amounts for KRIP were as follows:
                                                           December 31,
                                                         1994      1993

        Discount rate                                     8.5%     7.25%
        Salary increase rate                                5%        4%
        Long-term rate of return on plan assets           9.5%      9.5%


The Company also sponsors another plan for certain U.S. employees (primarily 
executives).  The benefits of this plan are obtained by applying KRIP 
provisions to all compensation, including compensation currently being 
deferred, and without regard to the legislated qualified plan maximums, 
reduced by benefits under KRIP.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the projected 
benefit obligation of this plan amounted to $140 million and $131 million, 
respectively.  The Company had recorded long-term liabilities at those dates 
of $124 million and $126 million, respectively.  Pension expense for continuing 
operations recorded in 1994, 1993 and 1992 related to this plan was 
$17 million, $15 million and $13 million, respectively.

Most subsidiaries and branches operating outside the U.S. have retirement 
plans covering substantially all employees.  Contributions by the Company for 
these plans are typically deposited under government or other fiduciary-type 
arrangements.  Retirement benefits are generally based on contractual 
agreements that provide for benefit formulas using years of service and/or 
compensation prior to retirement.  The actuarial assumptions used for these 
plans reflect the diverse economic environments within the various countries 
in which the Company operates.  The financial impact of these plans is 
insignificant to the Company.

NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS


Nonpension postretirement expense for continuing operations for 1994 and 1993 
was $183 million and $255 million, respectively.  Prior to 1993, these costs 
were accounted for on a "pay-as-you-go" basis and were $100 million in 1992.

The Company provides healthcare, dental and life insurance benefits to 
eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees.  In general, these 
benefits are provided to U.S. retirees that are covered by the provisions of 
the Company's principal pension plan.  The Company has amended healthcare, 
dental, and life insurance benefits provided to eligible retirees and eligible 
survivors of retirees.  The Company announced in 1992 a cap for people 
retiring after January 1, 1993 that would freeze the Company's contribution to 
healthcare and dental costs in the year when costs were twice the average 
amount paid in 1992.  

In 1994, the Company announced that it will set a cap on the amount the 
Company pays for healthcare and dental costs in the future for many people who 
retired prior to January 1, 1993.  This new cap will become effective in the 
year 2000 or the year in which the previously announced cap becomes effective, 
whichever is later.  In addition, the basis of the Company's contribution to 
healthcare for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees will be a 
managed care program.  The reduction of SFAS No. 106 costs generated by the 
above changes as well as economic assumption changes in 1994 was $90 million 
($57 million after-tax).

A few of the Company's subsidiaries and branches operating outside the U.S. 
offer healthcare benefits; however, the cost of such benefits is insignificant 
to the Company.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 106 on January 1, 1993.  The obligation for 
continuing operations owed to current and retired employees, as of January 1, 
1993, was recognized on that date as a cumulative effect of a change in 
accounting principle of $1,557 million after-tax.  The Company plans to 
continue to fund these benefit costs on a "pay-as-you-go" basis and, 
consequently, the adoption of SFAS No. 106 will not significantly affect the 
Company's cash flows.

The net postretirement benefit cost for continuing operations includes the 
following components:

To estimate this obligation, healthcare costs were assumed to increase 10% in 
1995 with the rate of increase declining ratably to 5% by 2002 and thereafter.  
The discount rate utilized to measure the obligation at December 31, 1994 and 
1993, was 8.5% and 7.25%, respectively.  If the healthcare cost trend rates 
were increased by one percentage point, the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation for continuing operations, as of December 31, 1994, would increase 
by approximately $129 million while the net postretirement benefit cost for the 
year then ended would increase by approximately $17 million.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112.  The obligation 
for continuing operations as of January 1, 1993 was recognized as a cumulative 
effect of a change in accounting principle of $150 million ($92 million 
after-tax).  Adoption of SFAS No. 112 did not have a material effect on the 
Company's earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
principle.

STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

The 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan provides for a variety of awards 
to key employees.  Some of these awards are based upon performance criteria 
relating to the Company established by the Executive Compensation and 
Development Committee of the Board of Directors.

The 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan provides that options can be 
granted through January 31, 1995, to key employees for the purchase of up to 
16,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an option price not less 
than 50 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the stock 
option's grant.  No options below fair market value have been granted to date.  
Options with dividend equivalents were awarded during 1994, 1993 and 1992 
under the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan.  Provisions under this 
plan amounted to $6 million in 1994, $5 million in 1993 and $5 million in 1992.
The 1990 Plan also provides for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights 
(SARs) either in tandem with options or freestanding.  SARs allow optionees to 
receive a payment equal to the appreciation in market value of a stated number 
of shares of the Company's common stock from the SARs exercise price to the 
market value on the date of its exercise.  Exercise of a tandem SAR requires 
the optionee to surrender the related option.  At December 31, 1994, there 
were 198,912 tandem SARs and 558,712 freestanding SARs outstanding at option 
prices ranging from $30.25 to $44.50.

The 1985 Stock Option Plan provided that options could be granted through 1989 
to key employees for the purchase of up to 6,000,000 (prior to giving effect 
to the 3-for-2 partial stock split in 1987) shares of the Company's common 
stock at an option price not less than the per share fair market value at the 
time the option was granted.  Options granted have maximum durations of 7 or 
10 years from the date of grant but may expire sooner if the optionee's 
employment terminates.  The 1985 Plan also provided for the granting of SARs 
either in tandem with options or freestanding.  At December 31, 1994, there 
were 661,457 tandem SARs and 68,205 freestanding SARs outstanding at option 
prices ranging from $33.79 to $39.53.

Summarized option data as of December 31, 1994 are as follows:

                                                  Shares        Range of Price

At December 31, 1994, 16,689,314 of the options outstanding were exercisable.

Approximately 725,000 options were surrendered in 1994 as a result of the 
spin-off of the Company's worldwide chemical business on December 31, 1993.

ACQUISITION OF REMAINING SHARES OF QUALEX

In August 1994, the Company acquired the remaining shares of Qualex, a 
photofinisher operating primarily in the U.S.  Prior to August 12, 1994, the 
Company had an investment in Qualex of approximately fifty percent of its 
outstanding common shares, which was accounted for under the equity method.

The Company purchased the remaining shares of Qualex for $150 million with a 
combination of cash and a note.  At December 31, 1994, $100 million remains to 
be paid in two equal installments in February and August 1995 and is included 
in "payables".  The tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, 
principally receivables and properties, amounted to approximately $375 
million.  The liabilities assumed, principally debt, amounted to approximately 
$410 million.  After recognizing the amount of the Company's investment which 
had been recorded by the Company prior to the acquisition date, approximately 
$160 million, the amount of goodwill resulting from this acquisition 
approximated $345 million.  The Company's investment in Qualex was previously 
included in "long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets".  The results 
of operations of Qualex are included in the Company's Consolidated Statement 
of Earnings for the period following the transaction date as a component of 
the Consumer Imaging segment.  Net sales and costs of sales amounts 
consolidated for this period were $279 million and $200 million, respectively.  
Current and prior year pro forma information for the acquisition is not 
presented due to its relative insignificance.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

In conjunction with the Company's intention to focus its attention on its 
consumer and commercial imaging businesses, the Company has changed its 
segments for financial reporting purposes.  The Consumer Imaging business 
unit, which was previously included in the former Imaging segment, is now 
reported as a separate segment.  The Commercial Imaging segment includes the 
other business units from the former Imaging segment, the business units from 
the former Information segment, Digital and Applied Imaging operations and the 
Health Sciences business unit, which was previously included in the Health 
segment.  Financial data for prior periods have been restated to conform with 
the 1994 segment presentation.

The products of each segment are manufactured and marketed both in the U.S. 
and in other parts of the world.  The Consumer Imaging segment includes 
amateur films, photographic papers, chemicals and equipment for photographic 
imaging and photofinishing operations.  The Commercial Imaging segment 
includes motion picture, professional and graphic arts films, microfilms, 
copiers, printers and other equipment for information management.  Sales 
between segments are made on a basis intended to reflect the market value of 
the products.

Sales are reported in the geographic area where they originate.  Transfers 
among geographic areas are made on a basis intended to reflect the market 
value of the products, recognizing prevailing market prices and distributor 
discounts.

(1)  After deducting $340 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $254 million, and $110 million loss on the extinguishment of 
     certain financial instruments, which reduced net earnings by $80 million.  Net earnings 
     were also reduced by $266 million of extraordinary losses related to the early 
     extinguishment of debt.
(2)  After deducting $495 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $353 million, and after deducting $55 million of restructuring 
     costs from discontinued operations, which reduced net earnings by $34 million.
(3)  The net loss for 1993 was due to an after-tax charge of $2.17 billion from the cumulative 
     effect of adopting SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other 
     Than Pensions, and SFAS No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.
(4)  After deducting $219 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $140 million, and after deducting $1 million of restructuring costs 
     from discontinued operations, which reduced net earnings by less than $1 million.
(5)  Net earnings for 1992 benefited by $152 million from the cumulative effect of adopting  
     SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
(6)  After deducting $1,448 million of restructuring costs from continuing operations, which 
     reduced net earnings by $934 million, and after deducting $157 million of restructuring 
     costs from discontinued operations, which reduced net earnings by $98 million.
(7)  After deducting $888 million for the litigation judgment, including post-judgment 
     interest, which reduced net earnings by $564 million.
(8)  Based on average number of shares outstanding.
(9)  The lower dividends in 1994 were due to the spin-off of the Eastman Chemical Company 
     operations at year-end 1993.  As a result of the spin-off, the Company's shareowners 
     received one share of Eastman Chemical Company stock for every four shares of Kodak common 
     stock.
(10) Data for 1993, 1992 and 1991 have been restated to reflect the new basis of two reporting 
     segments.
(11) The acquisition of Qualex during 1994 added approximately 7,600 people to the Company's 
     U.S. employment.  Acquisitions outside the U.S. during 1994 added approximately 1,200 
     people to the Company's employment levels.  Approximately 5,100 personnel left the Company 
     during 1994 under restructuring programs.

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS  Directors who are compensated as employees of the 
Company receive no additional compensation as directors.  Each director who is 
not an employee of the Company receives an annual retainer of $38,000, payable 
$20,000 in common stock of the Company and $18,000 in cash.  In addition, each 
such director receives a fee of $1,000 for each Board meeting attended and 
$900 for each Board committee and special meeting attended, and $1,000 for 
each Board committee and special meeting which he or she chairs.  There is a 
deferred compensation plan available to all such directors for the cash 
portion of their compensation, in which two directors participated in 1994.  
Directors participating in this plan may choose between an interest-bearing 
account and a phantom Kodak stock fund.  Each director who is not an employee 
of the Company is eligible to participate in a retirement plan for directors 
which provides an annual retirement benefit equal to the then-current annual 
retainer, if the director has served at least five years.  Directors who have 
served fewer than five years are entitled to a pro rata retirement benefit.  
Each director who is not an employee of the Company is covered by group term 
life insurance in the amount of $100,000, which decreases to $50,000 at the 
later of retirement from the Board under the retirement plan described above 
or age 65.  In the event of a change in control (as defined in the applicable 
plans) each account under the deferred compensation plan will be paid in a 
single lump sum cash payment and all retirement benefit payments will be paid 
in a single lump sum cash payment equal to the present value of the remaining 
retirement benefits.

Each non-employee director is eligible to participate in the Company's 
Directors' Charitable Award Program, which provides for a contribution by the 
Company of $1,000,000 following the director's death to up to four charitable 
institutions recommended by the director.  The individual directors derive no 
financial benefits from this Program, which is funded by joint life insurance 
policies purchased by the Company and self insurance.  The purposes of the 
Program are to further the Company's philanthropic endeavors, with particular 
emphasis on education, acknowledge the service of the Company's directors, 
recognize the interest of the Company and the directors in supporting worthy 
charitable and educational institutions and enable the Company to attract and 
retain directors of the highest caliber.  Directors who are participating in 
the Program are Messrs. Braddock, Duncan, Phelan, and Zimmerman, 
Drs. Emerson, Gray, and Kaske, and Gov. Collins.

COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  The individuals named in the following 
table were the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the four highest paid 
executive officers during 1994.

                           Long-Term Incentive Plan

In March 1993, the 1993-1995 Restricted Stock Program, a performance share 
unit arrangement under the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan, was 
approved by the Executive Compensation and Development Committee.  Payouts of 
Awards, if any, are tied to achieving specified levels of stock price, return 
on assets, and total shareholder return relative to the Standard & Poor's 500
Index, over the period 1993-1995.  The target amount will be earned if the
target level for each of these three criteria is achieved.  The target stock
price must be achieved to trigger a payment of 100% of target.  The threshold
stock price must be achieved to trigger a payment of 50% of target.  If the 
threshold stock price is not achieved, no payment is made.  The Committee will 
determine the payout based upon its review of Company performance at the end 
of the performance period.  Awards, if any, will be paid in the form of 
restricted stock, which restrictions will lapse upon the participant's 
attainment of age 60.  Participants who terminate employment for reasons of 
death, disability, retirement or an approved reason, prior to the completion 
of the performance cycle, will receive their award, if any, at the conclusion 
of the performance period in the form of shares of Kodak common stock with no 
restrictions.  Participation in this Program commenced in 1993 for the CEO and 
the other named executive officers, except H. L. Kavetas, whose participation 
commenced in 1994.  Shown in the table below is the threshold and target 
number of shares for H. L. Kavetas under this Program offset by the 12,810 
shares of restricted stock awarded to H. L. Kavetas under his employment 
contract.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

On October 27, 1993, the Company entered into an agreement covering a period 
of five years, for the employment of George M. C. Fisher as Chairman, 
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Upon execution of the 
agreement, Mr. Fisher received $5,000,000 as an inducement for entering into 
the agreement and as reimbursement for compensation and benefits that he would 
forfeit upon termination of his employment with his previous employer.  Mr. 
Fisher's base salary is $2,000,000, subject to review on an annual basis.  Mr. 
Fisher participates in MAPP and has an annual target award opportunity of at 
least $1,000,000, with that amount guaranteed for services rendered in each of 
1994 and 1995.  Mr. Fisher was granted 20,000 shares of restricted stock with 
the restrictions lapsing at the end of five years.  Pursuant to the agreement, 
Mr. Fisher was granted 1,323,539 stock options in 1993. The agreement provided 
for the Company to make two loans to Mr. Fisher in the total amount of 
$8,284,400 for five years with interest at the rate of 4.86% (which is the 
most recently announced rate under Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue 
Code, prior to the date of the loan).  $4,284,400 of this amount was loaned to 
Mr. Fisher due to his forfeiture of 80,000 stock options from his prior 
employer resulting from his accepting employment with the Company.  Mr. Fisher 
was required to use all of the loan proceeds except $1,500,000 to purchase 
Kodak stock.  The shares he purchased are reflected in the security ownership 
table.  Twenty percent of the principal and all of the accrued interest on 
each of these loans are to be forgiven on each of the first five anniversaries 
of such loans.  Forgiveness of the $4,000,000 loan is conditioned upon Mr. 
Fisher's not having voluntarily terminated his employment with the Company and 
forgiveness of the $4,284,400 loan is conditioned upon Mr. Fisher's not 
entering into competition with the Company.  The amount of the forgiveness for 
1994 is shown in the column of the Summary Compensation Table entitled "All 
Other Compensation", on page 54.

In addition, where necessary, Mr. Fisher has been given credit for a period of 
service sufficient to allow him to obtain the maximum benefit available under 
the Company's benefit plans.  In particular, Mr. Fisher was credited with five 
years of service for purposes of the Wage Dividend and seventeen years of 
service for purposes of calculating a retirement benefit.  Any pension benefit 
payable to Mr. Fisher by the Company will be offset by any pension benefit 
paid to Mr. Fisher by his prior employer.  The Company provided Mr. Fisher 
with an apartment until he purchased a permanent residence in the Rochester 
area.  The Company purchased Mr. Fisher's residence in Barrington Hills, 
Illinois.  In addition, the Company reimbursed Mr. Fisher for all closing 
costs associated with a previous residence, which was sold after he accepted 
employment with the Company.  The Company is providing Mr. Fisher with term 
life insurance equal to 3.5 times his base salary and a disability benefit 
equal to 60% of base salary.  In the event of Mr. Fisher's death prior to the 
termination of this agreement, the agreement provides for salary continuation 
for ninety days, the payment of the annual incentive for the year of his death 
and annual and long-term incentives earned but not yet paid, and vesting of 
all stock options and awards and the forgiveness of the loans. In the event of 
Mr. Fisher's disability prior to termination of the agreement, the agreement 
provides for a disability benefit payable to age 65, the payment of the annual 
incentive for the year in which his disability occurs and annual and long-term 
incentives earned but not yet paid, and vesting of all stock options and 
awards.  If Mr. Fisher's employment is terminated by the Company without 
cause, including following a change in control, Mr. Fisher is entitled to the 
greater of the remaining term of his employment contract or 36 months of 
salary continuation, immediate vesting of stock options, the lapsing of any 
restrictions on any restricted stock award and the payment of any incentive 
awards earned but not yet paid.  Mr. Fisher is entitled to reimbursement for 
taxes paid on certain of the foregoing payments, including any amounts 
constituting "parachute payments" under the Internal Revenue Code.  If Mr. 
Fisher dies prior to retirement, his spouse is entitled to a 50% survivor 
annuity.

On February 11, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement covering a period 
of five years, for the employment of Harry L. Kavetas as Chief Financial 
Officer of the Company.  Mr. Kavetas's base salary is $550,000, subject to 
review on an annual basis.  Mr. Kavetas participates in MAPP and has an annual 
target award opportunity of at least $330,000, with that amount guaranteed for 
services rendered in 1994.  Mr. Kavetas was granted 12,810 shares of 
restricted stock with the restrictions lapsing at the end of five years.  
Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Kavetas was granted 200,000 stock options that 
become exercisable at the end of five years.  

In addition, where necessary, Mr. Kavetas has been given credit for a period 
of service sufficient to allow him to obtain the maximum benefits available 
under Kodak's benefit plans.  In particular, Mr. Kavetas was credited with 
five years of service for purposes of the Wage Dividend and will be credited 
with six years of service for each of the first five years of employment for 
purposes of calculating a retirement benefit.  Any pension benefit payable to 
Mr. Kavetas by the Company will be offset by any pension benefit paid to Mr. 
Kavetas by his prior employer.  The Company provided Mr. Kavetas with 
temporary housing until he purchased a permanent residence in the Rochester 
area.  In the event of Mr. Kavetas's death prior to the termination of the 
agreement, the agreement provides for salary continuation for 90 days, the pro 
rata payment of all annual and long terms incentives and pro rata vesting of 
stock options and restricted stock awards.  In the event of Mr. Kavetas's 
disability prior to termination of the agreement, the agreement provides for 
the pro rata payment of all annual and long term incentives, and pro rata 
vesting of stock options and restricted stock awards.  If Mr. Kavetas's 
employment is terminated by the Company without cause, Mr. Kavetas is entitled 
to 18 months of salary continuation, immediate pro rata vesting of stock 
options and restricted stock awards and the payment of any incentive awards 
earned but not yet paid.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

The Company has a general severance arrangement available to substantially all 
employees.  This Termination Allowance Plan provides two weeks of compensation 
for every year of service with a maximum of fifty-two weeks of salary.

The Company has entered into a retention arrangement with Mr. Prezzano.  The 
agreement provides that if Mr. Prezzano's employment is terminated prior to 
September 30, 1995 by the Company other than for cause, or by Mr. Prezzano as 
a result of a diminution in duties or base salary, he shall be entitled to an 
unreduced retirement annuity and a termination allowance equal to two weeks of 
pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 52 weeks of pay.  The 
agreement also prohibits Mr. Prezzano from working for a competitor for a 
period of three years following termination of employment.

CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

In the event of a change in control, the following would occur:  (i) each 
participant in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan would receive the 
balance in his or her account in a single lump sum cash payment; (ii) each 
participant in the Management Annual Performance Plan would be paid his or her 
target award for such year and any other year for which payment of awards had 
not been made as of such date; and (iii) all outstanding stock options and 
stock appreciation rights would become fully vested and each holder would be 
paid in a lump sum cash payment the difference between the exercise price and 
market price of Kodak common stock on the date of such event; each of the 
foregoing payments would be made in a single lump sum cash payment as soon as 
possible but no later than the 90th day following such event.

RETIREMENT PLAN

The Company funds a tax-qualified, defined benefit pension plan for virtually 
all U.S. employees.  Retirement income benefits are based upon the 
individual's "average participating compensation," which is the average of 
three years of those earnings described in the Plan as "participating 
compensation."  "Participating compensation", in the case of the executive 
officers included in the Summary Compensation Table, is annual compensation 
(salary and Management Annual Performance Plan payments), including allowances 
in lieu of salary for authorized periods of absence, such as illness, vacation 
or holidays.

For an employee with up to 35 years of accrued service, the annual normal 
retirement income benefit is computed by multiplying the number of years of 
accrued service by the sum of (a) 1.3% of "average participating compensation" 
("APC") for the employee's final three years, plus (b) .3% of APC in excess of 
the average Social Security wage base for the employee's final three years.  
For an employee with more than 35 years of accrued service, the amount 
computed above is increased by 1% for each year in excess of 35 years.

The retirement income benefit is not subject to any deductions for Social 
Security benefits or other offsets.  Officers are entitled to benefits on the 
same basis as other employees.  The normal form of benefit is an annuity, but 
a lump sum payment is available as an option.

participant whose employment is terminated, for a reason other than death, 
disability, cause or voluntary resignation, within 5 years of the date of such 
event would be credited with up to 5 additional years of service and, where 
the participant is age 50 or over on the date of such event, up to 5 
additional years of age, for the following plan purposes:  (i) to determine 
eligibility for early and normal retirement; (ii) to determine eligibility for 
a vested right; and (iii) to calculate the amount of retirement benefit.  The 
actual number of years of service and years of age that would be granted to 
such a participant would decrease proportionately depending upon the number of 
years that elapse between the date of a change in control and the date of the 
participant's termination of employment.  Further, if the Plan is terminated 
within 5 years after a change in control, the benefit for each plan 
participant will be calculated as indicated above.

1994 Management Annual Performance Plan 


   SUMMARY

The Management Annual Performance Plan (MAPP) is a Kodak management- 
level compensation plan.  The compensation of each participant 
consists of a base salary and an annual award based on business 
performance.  Expected financial performance is considered the target 
level of performance and yields the participant's target award.  MAPP 
awards vary from zero, if  goals are not met, to a maximum of two 
times the target award.  Target awards range from 18% of base salary 
for the lowest level of participants to 75% of base salary for the 
CEO.  Payments are made to plan participants in April of 
the year following the year for which performance was measured.


   PLAN ADMINISTRATION

The Executive Compensation and Development Committee of the Board of 
Directors is responsible for:  policy setting and interpretation, 
approving performance goals at the Company and Group levels, 
evaluating Company and Group performance against the goals, and 
determining Company and Group level performance awards.  The Chief 
Executive Officer provides advice and counsel to the Committee.  
Management is responsible for administering the Plan.


   PARTICIPATION

The Plan is intended for management-level individuals in key roles 
which impact the financial performance of the organization.  
Participation is determined by Group Presidents and Senior Vice 
Presidents. The Chief Executive Officer is the final approval level 
for participation.

Individuals who become participants as a result of a job change begin 
participation on the first day of the month of their appointment to 
the new job, or on the following January 1 if the job change occurs 
late in the year.

Participants who retire, become disabled under the Kodak Long-Term 
Disability Plan, or leave the Company as part of an approved early 
separation program, receive a pro rata award at the normal time of 
payout based on base salary at the time of separation and financial 
performance at the end of the performance cycle (year-end).

The estates of participants who die receive a pro rata award based on 
base salary at the time of death and financial performance at the end 
of the performance cycle (year-end).

Participants who resign or are terminated for cause receive an award 
only if they worked until the end of a performance cycle (complete 
calendar year).

Participants who change jobs during a performance cycle receive a pro rata 
award for the interval of time spent in each job.  Pro rata awards are 
calculated using the base salary at year-end and are based on the financial 
performance of the full performance cycle (complete calendar year).


   GOAL SETTING

The Executive Compensation and Development Committee, in consultation with the 
Chief Executive Officer, establishes in December of each year the next year's 
financial goals for each performance level for:  total Company, Imaging Group, 
and the Health Group.  Each goal is weighed for importance in determining 
final awards.  Three performance levels are established:  Threshold, Target 
and Maximum.  On occasion, two of the levels may be set at the same 
performance level in order to reinforce business goals.

Within each Group, goals may be established at organizational levels below the 
Group.  If established, they are to be the same financial goals, 
aligned with Group goals, and approved by the Group President.  There 
are no individual or personal goals.


   GOAL WEIGHTING

Goals are weighted not only by specific financial performance measure 
but also by organizational position as follows: 

Position                      Corporate                  Group
 
Chief Executive Officer          100%                       0% 
Corporate Staffs                 100%                       0%
Group Presidents                  50%                      50% 
Corporate Officers in The Groups  35%                     *65%
Other                             25%                     *75%                  

             *Group President determines the weighting of these goals
               within the Group.


   AWARDS

   Award Pools

MAPP award pools are determined at the Group and Corporate Staffs levels.  An 
award pool is the amount of money required to pay all participants in a Group 
in relation to meeting specific performance levels (Threshold through Maximum) 
of financial performance in that Group.  For example, Imaging, Health and 
Corporate Staffs have a target level of financial performance set by the 
Executive Compensation and Development Committee of the Board for each MAPP 
performance level.  A corresponding award pool is determined for each 
performance level.  The award pools are calculated based on:  1) the number of 
MAPP participants in the Group; 2) their grade and salary levels at year-end; 
and 3) their target MAPP award (18% to 75%).  Following the conclusion of the 
performance cycle, the Committee conducts its evaluation of performance 
against goals in its February meeting.  At that time, award levels are 
determined and award pools established.

   Award Determination

The Executive Compensation and Development Committee, in consultation with the 
CEO, evaluates financial performance against agreed upon goals for the 
Corporation and for each Group.  In making its evaluation, the Committee takes 
into consideration unanticipated influences (e.g., economic downturn) 
impacting the difficulty of achieving the results, as well as performance 
relative to peer companies.  Peer company comparisons may be made at the Group 
level and for the Corporation.  The Committee decides, based on the 
recommendation of the CEO, the appropriate peer company comparisons for each 
Group and the Corporation.  In addition, the Committee judges results in 
relation to its expectations for improving overall shareowner return.  
Extraordinary gains and losses are included in financial performance 
evaluation both at Corporate and, where appropriate, at Group levels.  Major 
adjustments may be considered separately at the request of the CEO. Taking 
into account these various considerations, the Committee determines the 
performance award level for the Corporation and each Group.

The Threshold performance level established for each goal is the minimum 
hurdle for payment of award monies for performance against that goal.  The 
Threshold level must be attained before any award is earned for that goal.  
This applies at all organizational levels at which goals may be established.  
If goals are established below the Group level, the Group must earn some award 
monies for its performance before any sub-Group awards are paid.

After the award pools have been established, the CEO and the Group Presidents 
have the discretion to determine how a portion of the monies will be 
distributed.  Within each Group, the Group President has the latitude to 
redistribute up to 30 percent of the award funds resulting from non-corporate 
performance.  The CEO has the same latitude to redistribute up to 30 percent 
of the award funds within the Corporate Staffs units.  No additional award 
monies are created, solely a redistribution.  The potential redistribution 
will be based upon performance achievements -- tangible, quantifiable results 
- - -- of individuals or units.  It is intended to provide the ability to 
recognize special contributions and provide a greater level of accountability.

The Executive Compensation and Development Committee approves actual MAPP 
award amounts for the following:  Chief Executive Officer, Group Presidents, 
Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President - Legal, Senior Vice President 
- - - Human Resources and the five highest paid officers listed in the proxy, if 
they are different from individuals  in the positions identified above.

<PAGE> 73


Unacceptable individual performance, as determined by management, may 
result in no performance award, regardless of Company, Group or unit 
performance.  Management has discretion to override the established 
guidelines to avoid inappropriate or inequitable results.  Final 
approval for such an override resides at the Group President or 
equivalent level.  The Chief Executive Officer may recommend to the 
Executive Compensation and Development Committee that no awards be 
paid through this plan should the Company's overall financial 
performance warrant such action.


   Award Calculation

   Achievement Level               Award Factor 

   Maximum                              2X
   Target (Expected Performance)        1X
   Threshold                          .25X

   X = Target Award %

Awards are paid in April, for performance in the previous year, based 
on goal achievement.  In the example below, the participant has three 
goals, one with a weighting of 20% and each of the other two weighted 
40%.  The weighted performance is calculated on a scale of zero (0) to 200, 
with Target equal to 100.  In this way, regardless of their target award 
percentage (18% to 75%), the performance for all participants can be 
calculated using the same scale.  In the example, the performance for goal 1 
was 125, resulting in a weighted performance (20% times 125) of 25.  Goal 2 
performance was 75 on the 200 scale (weighted performance was 30 [75 times 
40%]).  Goal 3 performance was 150 (weighted performance was 60 [150 times 
40%]).  This resulted in a total weighted performance of 115%.




                        Performance Levels 

           Maximum               Target               Threshold 
             200                  100                    25

Goals      Weight %                     Weighted Performance 

1           20                    125            25%     
2           40                     75            30%
3           40                    150            60%      
                                        Total = 115%

In this example, consider that the participant had a year-end base 
salary of $90,000 and a target award of 18% of base salary.  To  
calculate this participant's award, determine the Target Award and 
multiply it by the Total Weighted Performance.

<PAGE> 74

   Target Award = Base Salary times Target Award Percent
      Target Award = $90,000 X 18% = $16,200

   Performance Award = Target Award times Total Weighted Performance
      Performance Award = $16,200 X 115.0% = $18,630

This Performance Award might then be increased or decreased based upon the 
potential redistribution of a portion of the available award 
monies by the CEO or Group President.


   RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
   MAPP AND PERFORMANCE APPRAISALS

MAPP is intended to reward participants for the achievement of a few focused 
financial goals.  Performance appraisals and rate reviews determine an 
individual's base salary with consideration for overall performance relative 
to the expectations for the job.  MAPP is financially and organizationally 
oriented while performance appraisals are more individually oriented.


   SALARY ADJUSTMENT UPON ENTRY INTO MAPP

MAPP is a variable compensation, or pay at risk, program.  
Participants have their base salary administered on reduced rate 
ranges.  New participants to MAPP are immediately administered on the 
reduced rate range for their assigned grade.  This may reduce or 
eliminate promotional increases, depending upon the person's pay 
position in the rate range for their new grade.  Subsequent salary 
treatment will depend upon pay/performance relationships in the 
reduced rate range for their assigned grade.


   RELATIONSHIP TO BENEFITS

Benefits are calculated as follows:

                      Base Salary
                      and Actual      Base Salary &   Base
Benefit Plan          MAPP Received   Targeted MAPP   Salary Rate

   PLAN AUDIT

The Director of Executive Compensation and Corporate Compensation 
Planning has responsibility for monitoring and reporting on the 
administration and effectiveness of MAPP.  The role of that position 
is to provide independent objective appraisal and guidance to both 
the Executive Compensation and Development Committee of the Board and 
the CEO in the administration of MAPP.  Each year, the Director will 
provide a formal review to the Committee and the CEO on the overall 
effectiveness of MAPP.

      made or, if such day is not a trading day, the immediately preceding 
      trading day.

      Section 1.12.   "Plan" means the Eastman Kodak Company Deferred 
      Compensation Plan For Directors as adopted by the Board and amended.

      Section 1.13.  "Participant" means (i) any member of the Board who is

      a balance in an Account under the Plan.

      Section 1.14.  "Stock Account" means the account established by Kodak 
      for each Participant, the performance of which shall be measured by 
      reference to the Market Value of Common Stock.  The maintenance of 
      individual Stock Accounts is for bookkeeping purposes only.

      Section 1.15.  "Valuation Date" means, with regards to a Participant's 
      Deferred Compensation Account, the last day of each calendar month and,

               participate in the Plan.

Section 4.     Deferral of Compensation.  For any given calendar year, a 
Participant may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion of his or her 
Deferrable Amount to be earned during such year.  Any Deferrable Amount  which 
is so deferred shall be credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation 
Account.  A Participant may not defer the receipt of any Deferrable Amounts 
directly to his or her Stock Account, but can only transfer amounts to such 
Account pursuant to Section 8.

                                                              <PAGE> 81

Section 5.     Time of Election of Deferral.  A Participant who wishes to defer 
compensation must irrevocably elect to do so during an Enrollment Period.

An  election made in accordance with Section 7 below shall be effective for 
the calendar year immediately following the Enrollment Period during which 
such election was made and for all succeeding calendar years, unless the 
Participant revokes his or her election or files a new election during the 
Enrollment Period for such a succeeding calendar year.  In which case, such 
revocation or election, as the case may be, shall be effective on the first 
day of such succeeding calendar year.

Section 6.     Hypothetical Investments.  

      Section 6.1.  Deferred Compensation Account.  Amounts in a Participant's 
      Deferred Compensation Account are hypothetically invested in an interest 
      bearing account which bears interest computed at the Interest Rate, 
      compounded monthly.

      Section 6.2.  Stock Account.  Amounts in a Participant's Stock Account 
      are hypothetically invested in units of Common Stock.  Amounts 
      transferred to a Stock Account are recorded as units of Common Stock, 
      and fractions thereof, with one unit equating to a single share of 
      Common Stock.  Thus, the value of one unit shall be the Market Value of 
      a single share of Common Stock.  The use of units is merely a 
      bookkeeping convenience; the units are not actual shares of Common 
      Stock.  Kodak will not reserve or otherwise set aside any Common Stock 
      for or to any Stock Account.

Section 7.     Manner of Electing Deferral.  A Participant may elect to defer 
compensation by executing and returning to the Administrator during the 
Enrollment Period a deferred compensation form provided by Kodak upon which 
the Participant shall indicate the amount of 
the Deferrable Amount to be deferred.

Amounts to be deferred shall be credited to the Participant's Deferred 
Compensation Account on the date such amounts would otherwise be payable.

Section 8.     Investment in the Stock Account.

      Section 8.1.  Elections.  A Participant may direct that all or any 
      portion, designated as a whole dollar amount, of the existing balance of 
      one of his or her Accounts be transferred to his or her other Account, 
      effective as of the close of business on the last day of any calendar 
      month (hereinafter the election's "Effective Date"), by filing a written 
      election with the Administrator on or prior to such date.

      Section 8.2.  Election into the Stock Account.  If a Participant elects 
      pursuant to Section 8.1 to transfer an amount from his or her Deferred 
      Compensation Account to his or her Stock Account, effective as of the 
      election's Effective Date, (i) his or her  Stock Account shall be 
      credited with that number of units of Common Stock, and fractions 
      thereof, obtained by dividing the dollar amount elected to be 
      transferred by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the Valuation 
      Date immediately preceding or coincident with the election's Effective 
      Date; and (ii) his or her Deferred Compensation Account shall be reduced 
      by the amount elected to be transferred.

      Section 8.3.  Election out of the Stock Account.  If a Participant 
      elects pursuant to Section 8.1 to transfer an amount from his or her 
      Stock Account to his or her Deferred Compensation Account, effective as 
      of the election's Effective Date, (i) his or her Deferred Compensation 
      Account shall be credited with a dollar amount equal to the amount 
      obtained by multiplying the number of units to be transferred by the 
      Market Value of the Common Stock on the Valuation Date immediately 
      preceding or coincident with the election's Effective Date; and (ii) his 
      or her Stock Account shall be reduced by the number of units elected to 
      be transferred.

      Section 8.4.  Dividend Equivalents.  Effective as of the payment date 
      for each cash dividend on the Common Stock, additional units of Common 
      Stock shall be credited to the Stock Account of each Participant who has 
      a balance in his or her Stock Account on the record date for such 
      dividend.  The number of units that shall be credited to the Stock 
      Account of such a Participant shall be computed by multiplying the 
      dollar value of the dividend paid upon a single share of Common Stock by 
      the number of units of Common Stock held in the Participant's Stock 
      Account on the record date for such dividend and dividing the product 
      thereof by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date for 
      such dividend.

      Section 8.5.  Stock Dividends.  Effective as of the payment date for 
      each stock dividend (as defined in Section 305 of the Internal Revenue 
      Code of 1986) on the Common Stock, additional units of Common Stock 
      shall be credited to the Stock Account of each Participant who has a 
      balance in his or her Stock Account on the record date for such 
      dividend.  The number of units that shall be credited to the Stock 
      Account of such a Participant shall equal the number of shares of Common 
      Stock which the Participant would have received as stock dividends had 
      he or she been the owner on the record date for such stock dividend of 
      the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of units 
      credited to his or her Stock Account on such record date.  To the extent 
      the Participant would have also received cash, in lieu of fractional 
      shares of Common Stock, had he or she been the record owner of such 
      shares for such stock dividend, then his or her Stock Account shall also 
      be credited with that number of units, or fractions thereof, equal to 
      such cash amount divided by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the 
      payment date for such dividend.

      Section 8.6.  Recapitalization.  If Kodak undergoes a reorganization as 
      defined in Section 368 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the 
      Administrator may, in his or her sole and absolute discretion, take 
      whatever action he or she deems necessary, advisable or appropriate with 
      respect to the Stock Accounts in order to reflect such transaction, 
      including, but not limited to, adjusting the number of units credited to 
      a Participant's Stock Account.

      Section 8.7.  Distributions.  Amounts in respect of units of Common 
      Stock shall be distributed in cash in accordance with Sections 9, 10 and 
      17.  For purposes of a distribution pursuant to Section 9, 10 or 17, the 
      number of units to be distributed from a Participant's Stock Account 
      shall be valued by multiplying the number of such units by the Market 
      Value of the Common Stock as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding 
      the date such distribution is to occur.  Pending the complete 
      distribution under Section 9.2 of the Stock Account of a Participant who 
      is no longer a member of the Board, the Participant shall continue to be 
      able to make elections pursuant to Sections 8.2 and 8.3 and his or her 
      Stock Account shall continue to be credited with additional units of 
      Common Stock pursuant to Sections 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6.

Section 9.     Payment of Deferred Compensation.  

      Section 9.1.  Background.  No withdrawal may be made from a 
      Participant's Accounts except as provided in this Section 9 and Sections 
      10 and 17.

      Section 9.2.  Manner of Payment.  Payment of a Participant's Accounts 
      shall be made at the sole discretion of the Administrator in a single 
      sum or in annual installments.  The maximum number of annual 
      installments is ten.  All payments from the Plan shall be made in cash.

      Section 9.3.  Timing of Payments.  Payments shall be made on the fifth 
      business day in March and shall commence in any year designated by the 
      Administrator up through the tenth year following the year in which the 
      Participant for any reason ceases to be a member of the Board.

      Section 9.4.  Valuation.  The amount of each payment shall be equal to 
      the value, as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, of the 
      Participant's Accounts, divided by the number of installments remaining 
      to be paid.  If payment of a Participant's Accounts is determined by the 
      Administrator to be paid in installments and the Participant has a 
      balance in his or her Stock Account at the time of the payment of an 
      installment, the amount that shall be distributed from his or her Stock 
      Account shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the total amount of 
      the installment determined in accordance with the immediately preceding 
      sentence by the percentage obtained by dividing the balance in the Stock 
      Account as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date by the total 
      value of the Participant's Accounts as of such Valuation Date.  
      Similarly, in such case, the amount that shall be distributed from the 
      Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be the amount obtained 
      by multiplying the total amount of the installment determined in 
      accordance with the first sentence of this Section 9.4 by the percentage 
      obtained by dividing the balance in the Deferred Compensation Account as 
      of the immediately preceding Valuation Date by the total value of the 
      Participant's Accounts as of such Valuation Date.

Section 10. Payment of Deferred Compensation After Death.  If a Participant 
dies prior to complete payment of his or her Accounts, the provisions of this 
Section 10 shall become operative.

      Section 10.1.  Stock Account.  Effective as of the date of a 
      Participant's death, the entire balance of his or her Stock Account 
      shall be transferred to his or her Deferred Compensation Account.  For 
      purposes of valuing the units of Common Stock subject to such a 
      transfer, the deceased Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall 
      be credited with a dollar amount equal to the amount obtained by 
      multiplying the number of units in the deceased Participant's Stock 
      Account at the time of his or her death by the Market Value of the 
      Common Stock on the date of his or her death.  Thereafter, no amounts in 
      the deceased Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be 
      eligible for transfer to the deceased Participant's Stock Account by any 
      person, including, but not by way of limitation, the deceased 
      Participant's beneficiary or legal representative.

      Section 10.2.  Distribution.  The balance of the Participant's Accounts, 
      valued as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date payment 
      is made, shall be paid in a single, lump-sum payment to: (1) the 
      beneficiary or contingent beneficiary designated by the Participant in 
      accordance with Section 10.3; or, in the absence of a valid designation 
      of a beneficiary or contingent beneficiary, (2) the Participant's estate 
      within 30 days after appointment of a legal representative of the 
      deceased Participant.

      Section 10.3.  Beneficiary Designation.  Each Participant shall have the 
      right, at any time, to designate any person or persons as his or her 
      Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (both primary and contingent) to whom 
      payment under this Plan shall be paid in the event of his or her death 
      prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the benefits due 
      him or her under the Plan.  Each Beneficiary designation shall become 
      effective only when filed in writing with the Administrator during the 
      Participant's lifetime on a form provided by the Administrator.  The 
      filing of a new Beneficiary designation form with the Administrator will 
      cancel all Beneficiary designation(s) previously filed.

Section 11.    Participant's Rights Unsecured.  The amounts payable under the 
Plan shall be unfunded, and the right of any Participant or his or her estate 
to receive any payment under the Plan shall be an unsecured claim against the 
general assets of Kodak.  No Participant shall have the right to exercise any 
of the rights or privileges of a shareholder with respect to the units 
credited to his or her Stock Account.

Section 12.    Non-Assignability.  The right of a Participant to the payment of 
deferred compensation as provided in this Plan shall not be subject in any 
manner to alienation, anticipation, sale, transfer (except by will or the laws 
of descent and distribution), assignment, pledge, or encumbrance.

Section 13.    Statement of Account.  Statements will be sent no less
frequently than annually to each Participant or his or her beneficiary or
estate showing the value of the Participant's Accounts.

Section 14.    Administration.  

      Section 14.1.  Responsibility.  The Administrator of the Plan shall be 
      the Comptroller of Kodak.  The Administrator shall have total and 
      exclusive responsibility to control, operate, manage and administer the 
      Plan in accordance with its terms.

      Section 14.2.  Authority of the Administrator.  The Administrator shall 
      have all the authority that may be necessary or helpful to enable him or 
      her to discharge his or her responsibilities with respect to the Plan.  
      Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the 
      Administrator shall have the exclusive right: to interpret the Plan, to 
      determine eligibility for participation in the Plan, to decide all 
      questions concerning eligibility for and the amount of benefits payable 
      under the Plan, to construe any ambiguous provision of the Plan, to 
      correct any default, to supply any omission, to reconcile any 
      inconsistency, and to decide any and all questions arising in the 
      administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan.  

      Section 14.3.  Discretionary Authority.  The Administrator shall have 
      full discretionary authority in all matters related to the discharge of 
      his or her responsibilities and the exercise of his or her authority 
      under the Plan including, without limitation, the construction of the 
      terms of the Plan and the determination of eligibility for participation 
      and benefits under the Plan.  It is the intent of the Plan that the 
      decisions of the Administrator and his or her actions with respect to 
      the Plan shall be final and binding upon all persons having or claiming 
      to have any right or interest in or under the Plan and that no such 
      decision or action shall be modified upon judicial review unless such 
      decision or action is proven to be arbitary or capricious.

      Section 14.4.  Delegation of Authority.  The Administrator may delegate 
      some or all of his or her authority under the Plan to any person or 
      persons provided that any such delegation be in writing.

Section 15.    Amendment.  The Plan may at any time or from time to time be 
amended, modified, suspended or terminated by resolution of the Board.  
However, no amendment, modification, or termination shall, without the consent 
of a Participant, adversely affect such Participant's accruals in his or her 
Accounts.

Section 16.    Governing Law.  The Plan shall be construed, governed and
enforced in accordance with the law of New York State, except as such laws
are preempted by applicable federal law.

Section 17.    Change in Control.

      Section 17.1.  Background.  Upon a Change In Control: (i) the terms of 
      this Section 17 shall immediately become operative, without further 
      action or consent by any person or entity, (ii) all terms, conditions, 
      restrictions, and limitations in effect on any deferred compensation 
      shall immediately lapse as of the date of such event; and (iii) no other 
      terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations shall be imposed 
      upon any deferred compensation on or after such date, and in no 
      circumstance shall any Account be forfeited on or after such date.

      Section 17.2.  Payment of Deferred Compensation.  Upon  a Change in 
      Control, each Participant, whether or not he or she is still a member of 
      the Board, shall be paid in a single, lump-sum cash payment the balance 
      of his or her Accounts as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding 
      the date payment is made.  Such payment shall be made as soon as 
      practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the date of the 
      Change in Control.

      Section 17.3.  Amendment On or After Change In Control.  Upon a Change 
      in Control, no action, including, but not by way of limitation, the 
      amendment, modification, suspension or termination of the Plan, shall be 
      taken which would affect the rights of any Participant or the operation 
      of this Plan with respect to the balance in the Participant's Accounts.

Section 18.  No Guarantee of Tax Consequences.  No person connected with the 
Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited to, Kodak and its directors, 
officers, agents and employees makes any representation, commitment, or

                (B)   All Employees, other than regular part-time

    (c)   When an Employee's employment classification changes from a
          part-time class to a full-time class described above, or from a
          full-time class to a part-time class described above, the hours
          component of IASR is adjusted as of the date of such
          reclassification for determining Benefits and Price Tags.

    (d)   Because the individual rate for certain commission-eligible
          employees is reduced below the normal rate for their applicable
          salary grade, IASR is adjusted by multiplying the individual rate
          times the commission calculating factor for the appropriate
          commission plan specified in Compensation Plan 2C1.

    (e)   Because the base salary rate for each Employee eligible for certain
          management performance incentives is reduced below the normal rate
          for his applicable salary grade, IASR is adjusted to reflect what
          the normal rate would be in the absence of the reduction under the
          management performance incentive arrangement.
 
    (f)   Because the base salary rate for each Employee of the Eastman 
          Chemical Company participating in the Success Sharing Program is
          reduced  below the normal rate for his applicable salary rate, IASR
          is adjusted to reflect what the normal rate would be in the absence
          of the reduction under the Success Sharing Program.

         Schedule issued by the Plan Administrator.

   b)  Disabled Persons.  Disabled persons who were covered under the SGLI 
       Plan on the effective date of their disability and have been covered on 
       a continuous basis since that date.

   c)  Retirees.  Retirees who were covered under the SGLI Plan on a 
       continuous basis since the date which they first became eligible for

       who was a Key Employee on or after January 1, 1984, and who was not age 
       55 or older on that date may not participate in the SGLI Plan after 
       December 31, 1986.


ARTICLE 4.   AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AND COST

4.01 Coverage for Employees and Disabled Persons

The amount of SGLI for a covered Employee is 2.0 times his IASR.  The amount 
of coverage for any covered Employee will never be reduced except in the case 
of a decrease in IASR because of a general wage decrease.

If a covered Employee becomes disabled under the LTD Plan, the amount of 
coverage in force immediately before the effective date of disability will be 
continued for the duration of the disability.

4.02 Coverage for Retirees

If retirement occurs prior to age 65 following the completion of 10 or more 
years of service, the coverage will be continued in full through age 65.  The 
coverage in effect at age 65 will be reduced in five equal decrements on the 
first of the month following each of the Retiree's 66th through 70th 
birthdays.
<PAGE>
                                                              <PAGE> 94
 
The amount of the reduction varies according to the Retiree's years of 
service.  The level of coverage at age 70 and later is expressed as a 
percentage of the coverage in effect at age 65 as shown in the following 
table:

                                  Coverage at Age 70
                                  as a Percentage of           
Years of Service                  Coverage at Age 65*

   10                                     25
   11                                     27 1/2
   12                                     30
   13                                     32 1/2
   14                                     35
   15                                     37 1/2
   16                                     40
   17                                     42 1/2
   18                                     45
   19                                     47 1/2
   20 or more                             50

    *Coverage in retirement will be based on one of two factors, whichever
     is more beneficial to the Subscriber:

   (1)  the amount of coverage at age 65, or
   (2)  the amount of coverage at retirement.

   The higher of these two amounts will be multiplied by the appropriate
   percentage from this column (the percentage used is that corresponding to
   the Subscriber's years of service, prorated for partial years).

If retirement occurs at age 65 following the completion of 10 or more years of 
service, the SGLI coverage will be reduced in five equal decrements so that 
coverage at age 70 will be as described in the above table.

If retirement occurs after age 65 following the completion of at least 10 but 
less than 20 years of service, the SGLI coverage will be reduced to the level 
which would have been in effect had retirement occurred at age 65.

For a retirement occurring after age 65 with the completion of 20 or more 
years of service, the coverage in effect at retirement will be reduced on the 
first of the month following each of the retiree's birthdays through age 70 in 
accordance with the following table:

            Ages                     Level Available

             66                       1.80 Times IASR
             67                       1.60   "     "
             68                       1.40   "     "
             69                       1.20   "     "
             70 & Over                1.00   "     "

If a covered Employee completed at least 5 but fewer than 10 years of service 
as of the date of retirement, the coverage will be reduced to $1,000 upon 
retirement; for those with fewer than 5 years of service, the coverage will be 
reduced to $500 upon retirement.

Coverage will be canceled upon retirement if it has not been maintained 
continuously since the date on which the Subscriber first became eligible for 
coverage.

4.03 Cost

SGLI is non-contributory for Retirees, Disabled Persons while they remain 
disabled, and, in some cases, for eligible Employees as specified in Section 
10.01.

<PAGE>
                                                              <PAGE> 95

4.04 Contribution Rate for Employees

For covered Employees who are age 60 or older and for covered Key Employees, 
regardless of age, the monthly cost of SGLI is 60 cents per $1,000 of 
coverage.  For covered Employees younger than age 60, the monthly cost of SGLI 
is 38 cents per $1,000 of coverage.

Contributions for a year are based on the Employee's IASR as of January 1 of 
that year.


ARTICLE 5.   BENEFICIARIES

5.01 Beneficiaries

The Subscriber can name one or more primary beneficiaries plus one or more 
contingent beneficiaries.  If a beneficiary dies before the Subscriber dies, 
the rights and interest of that beneficiary automatically terminate.

All beneficiary designations must be made on forms approved by the Plan 
Administrator.

5.02 Changing a Beneficiary

A Subscriber can change his SGLI beneficiaries at any time without the consent 
of those beneficiaries.  All notices of beneficiary change must be made on 
forms approved by the Plan Administrator.  When the notice of change is 
received by the Company, it will take effect on the date the notice was 
signed, whether or not the Subscriber is living at the time such notice is 
received.  However, both the Company and the Insurance Company are discharged 
from any further liability if a previously named beneficiary is paid before 
the Company receives a change-of-beneficiary form.

5.03 If No Beneficiary is Named

The proceeds of any SGLI in force when the Subscriber dies will be paid to the 
beneficiaries.  If there is no named beneficiary, if no named beneficiary is 
living, or if the beneficiary designation is invalid, payment will be made to 
the Subscriber's surviving Spouse; if none, to the Subscriber's surviving 
children in equal shares; if none, to the Subscriber's surviving parents in 
equal shares; if none, to the Subscriber's estate.


ARTICLE 6.   IRREVOCABLE ASSIGNMENT

The Subscriber's rights of ownership in the SGLI coverage may be assigned to 
another person or a trust for any purpose except as security for a loan.  
Assignments are irrevocable and, to be effective, must be approved by the 
Company and the Insurance Company.  The rights of ownership include the right 
to any future additional amounts of insurance provided by the coverage, the 
right 
to designate beneficiaries and elect settlement options, and the right to

ARTICLE 7.   CONTRIBUTIONS

7.01 First and Last Contribution

Subscriber contributions required for SGLI are taken from the first full week 
of coverage through the end of the month in which coverage terminates or, 
where coverage changes from contributory to non-contributory, through the end 
of the final month of contributory coverage.


ARTICLE 8.   PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

Payment of SGLI proceeds may be made under a number of options, including a 
lump-sum settlement, periodic installments, a life-income arrangement, an 
interest option, or a combination of these.  The Subscriber may leave the 
election to his beneficiary or he may make his election (revocably or 
irrevocably) in advance.

The number and form of the payment options, as well as the applicable interest 
rates, can change from time to time as determined by the Insurance Company.  
Up-to-date information and election forms are available from a Personnel 
Relations representative.


ARTICLE 9.   MAXIMUM BENEFITS

For subscribers to the Group Life Insurance/Survivor Benefit Insurance Plans, 
the combined maximum allowed under the Group Life Insurance Plan, the Survivor 
Benefit Insurance Plan, and SGLI Plan is $1,000,000 with SGLI being limited to 
$500,000.  If this combined maximum is reached, coverage is reduced in the 
following sequence:

   a)   Survivor Benefit Insurance
   b)   SGLI
   c)   Group Life Insurance

For subscribers to the Family Protection Program, the combined maximum amount 
payable for Basic Life Insurance, Optional Life Insurance and SGLI is 
$3,000,000.  If this combined maximum is reached, coverage is reduced in the 
following sequence:

   a)   Optional Life Insurance
   b)   SGLI
   c)   Basic Life Insurance


ARTICLE 10.   COVERAGE -- CONTINUATION, TERMINATION, CONVERSION,
              ON RETURN TO WORK

                                                              <PAGE> 97

10.01 Coverage Continuation

   a)   Leave of Absence.  If an Employee was a Subscriber immediately before 
        the leave, SGLI coverage may be continued during the leave if, before 
        the leave, the Subscriber makes arrangements to pay his contributions 
        during the leave.  Contributions will change if SGLI contribution 
        rates change during the leave.

        If a Subscriber who carried SGLI coverage during a leave fails to 
        return to work when the leave expires, coverage ends on the last day 
        of the month in which the leave expires.  If, before the leave 
        expires, the Company receives notification that the Subscriber does 
        not intend to return to work, coverage ends on the last day of the 
        month in which such notification is received.

   b)   Layoff.  SGLI coverage continues on a non-contributory basis for four 
        months after the end of the month in which the layoff commenced.

   c)   Short-Term Disability.  Where the employment of a Subscriber 
        terminates upon the exhaustion of benefits payable under the 
        Short-Term Disability Plan and the Subscriber does not qualify for 
        benefits under the Long-Term Disability Plan, SGLI coverage continues 
        on a noncontributory basis for two months following the month in which 
        employment terminates.

   d)   Retirement or Long Term Disability.  If a person was a Subscriber 
        immediately before his effective date of retirement under the Kodak 
        Retirement Income Plan or immediately before the date on which he 
        became a Disabled person, coverage continues as provided in Sections 
        4.01 and 4.02.

   e)   Termination Under Special Separation Plans.  The Company may, at its 
        option, extend coverage on a non-contributory basis for eligible 
        Employees whose employment terminates under any special separation 
        plan, special early retirement plan, or special early retirement 
        supplement plan.

   f)   Divestiture.  Where the employment of a Subscriber is terminated by 
        his or her Company due to a "divestiture," as defined in Section 
        10.05, by such Company and the Subscriber is not offered an 
        "equivalent job," as hereafter defined, in the same geographic area by 
        the acquirer, purchaser or other transferee of the division, business, 
        function, facility, unit or group of assets sold or otherwise disposed 
        of by way of the "divestiture," the SGLI coverage continues on a 
        noncontributory basis for the two (2) months following the month in 
        which employment terminates.  For purposes of this Article 10, an 
        "equivalent job" means any job whose base rate is within ten percent 
        (10%) of current base rate; except that in the Eastman Chemicals 
        Division, "equivalent job" means any job whose base rate is within ten 
        percent (10%) of the highest base rate held during the preceding 
        twelve (12) months.

   g)   Completion of Supplementary, Provisional or Special Program 
        Employment.  Supplementary Group Life Insurance coverage continues, on 
        a non-contributory basis, until the end of the month in which 
        supplementary or special program employment terminates.  However, if a 
        Subscriber accepts a transfer to a position as a Supplementary, 
        Provisional or Special Program Employee in lieu of layoff or 
        termination under a special separation plan, he will have SGLI 
        coverage on a non-contributory basis at the end of the supplementary, 
        provisional or special program employment for the period of time that 
        such coverage would have been available had he been laid off or 
        terminated under a special separation plan.

10.02 When Coverage Ends

SGLI coverage ends at midnight on the last day of the month in which the 
earliest of the following dates occurs:

   a)   The coverage termination date communicated by the Subscriber to the 
        Company in a written notice.

   b)   The date on which employment is terminated except as specified in 
        Section 10.01.

   c)   The date on which the group policy is discontinued.

SGLI coverage also ends at midnight on the last day of the month in which the 
earlier of the following events occurs:

   a)   The Subscriber fails to make a required monthly contribution for 
        contributory coverages.

   b)   The Employee-Subscriber who has not maintained continuous coverage 
        under SGLI retires.

10.03 Conversion Privilege

A conversion privilege is available for Supplementary Group Life Insurance 
when coverage ceases or is reduced under the circumstances described below:

   a)   Employment is Terminated.  If employment terminates for any reason, 
        coverage may be continued under an individual life insurance policy, 
        without disability or accidental death benefits.  The policy may be in 
        any form customarily issued by the Insurance Company, except term 
        insurance.  A Subscriber may, however, elect a term insurance policy 
        for a period of up to one year.  The amount of such individual policy 
        will be equal to (or at the Subscriber's option, less than) the amount 
        of his coverage in effect on his employment termination date.

   b)   The Group Policy is Terminated.  If the group policy is terminated, 
        then a Subscriber may obtain an individual policy of life insurance, 
        subject to the same terms and conditions as upon cessation of such 
        coverage due to termination of employment.  However, the amount of 
        such individual policy will not exceed the amount of the coverage 
        under the group policy on the date of cessation of such coverage, 
        reduced by any amount of coverage for which he may be or may become 
        eligible under any group policy issued or reinstated by the Insurance 
        Company or any other insurer within 45 days after such cessation.
<PAGE>
                                                              <PAGE> 99

   c)   Attainment of Certain Ages.  If the amount of a Subscriber's coverage 
        is reduced, for any reason upon attainment of age 65 or later, by at 
        least twenty percent (20%), the life insurance conversion privilege 
        described above will be available to him on the date of the reduction.  
        The twenty percent (20%) may be the result of one reduction or a 
        series of smaller reductions.  For any subsequent reduction in the 
        amount of his coverage which is at least twenty percent (20%), the 
        conversion privilege will again be available.  The amount of any 
        individual policy issued, as a result of any reduction, will not be 
        more than the amount of the reduction.  However, in the event that the 
        Subscriber does not apply for that amount during the conversion period 
        described below, he will not be able to apply for that amount during a 
        later conversion period which may be available to him.

Conversion periods begin on the first day following the day on which coverage 
terminates or is reduced by at least twenty percent (20%) and end 31 days 
thereafter.  If the Subscriber should die during a conversion period, the 
amount of his coverage will be payable to his beneficiary whether or not he 
applied for an individual policy.

If a Subscriber is not given written notice at least 15 days before or after 
the first day of the conversion period of the right to obtain an individual 
life insurance policy, he will have additional time in which to apply for such 
a policy.  If such notice is given more than 15 days but less than 90 days 
after the first day of the conversion period, he will then have 45 days from 
the date notice is given in which to apply for an individual policy.  In no 
event may a Subscriber apply later than the 90th day after the first day of 
the conversion period.

In any of the cases described above, to obtain an individual policy, a 
Subscriber must apply to the Insurance Company in writing and must pay the 
applicable premium no later than the last day of the conversion period.  The 
individual policy will become effective when the group coverage terminates.

10.04 Coverage on Return to Work After Termination or Leave of Absence

Continued participation in SGLI on reemployment, reinstatement (including 
return from retirement or Long-Term Disability), or return from leave of 
absence is based on the following provisions:

   a)   If a person was covered under the SGLI Plan continuously from the date 
        of leaving to the date of return and meets the requirements of Article 
        3 at the time of returning, such coverage is continued upon return.

   b)   In all other cases, this coverage is not available upon return to 
        work.

10.05 Divestiture

Except to the extent expressly provided in Section 10.01(f), a Subscriber 
whose employment by his or her Company is terminated due to a "divestiture," 
as defined below, by such Company is no longer eligible for SGLI coverage and, 
therefore, his or her coverage(s) shall end as specified in Section 10.02.  
For purposes of this Article 10, the term "divestiture" shall mean the sale or 
other disposition, other than a sale or disposition of a subsidiary company or 
venture, by a Company of a division, business, function, facility or unit or 
other group of assets.

ARTICLE 11.   ADMINISTRATION AND GENERAL PROVISIONS

Whenever a covered Employee or covered Disabled Person retires, insurance 
certificates are provided describing the provisions that apply specifically to 
him.

11.01 Plan Amendment, Suspension, or Termination

Eastman Kodak Company may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan in whole or in 
part at any time, for any reason.  For purposes of ERISA Section 402(b)(3), 
the procedure for amending, suspending and terminating the Plan is the 
adoption of a resolution by the Board or Benefit Plans Committee to such 
effect.  A resolution is considered adopted when a majority of the members of 
the Board or Benefit Plans Committee approve of the resolution by voice or 
written vote at a Board or Committee meeting, whichever is applicable, or if 
no meeting is held, the resolution is in writing and signed by all of the 
members of the Board or 
Benefit Plans Committee.

11.02 Claims and Appeal Procedures

The claims and appeal procedures are described in the General Administration 
section of You and Kodak.

11.03 Governing Law

This document shall be construed in accordance with the laws of New York 
State, except where the law of some other jurisdiction must be applied in 
respect of individual Subscribers or those claiming under or through them, and 
except as such laws are preempted by ERISA.

        constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any person 
        becoming a director subsequent to February 1, 1990 whose election, or

3.   Administration

The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  The Committee shall have the 
authority to:  (a) interpret the Plan; (b) establish such rules and 
regulations as it deems necessary for the proper operation and administration 
of the Plan; (c) select Key Employees to receive Awards under the Plan; (d) 
determine the form of an Award, whether a stock option, stock appreciation 
right, Stock Award, performance unit, performance share, or other incentive 
award established by the Committee in accordance with (h) below, the number of 
shares or Units subject to the Award, all the terms, conditions, restrictions 
and/or limitations, if any, of an Award, including the time and conditions of 
exercise or vesting, and the terms of any Award Notice; (e) determine whether 
Awards should be granted singly, in combination or in tandem; (f) grant 
waivers of Plan terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations; (g) 
accelerate the vesting, exercise, or payment of an Award or the performance 
period of an Award when such action or actions would be in the best interest 
of the Company; (h) establish such other types of Awards, besides those 
specifically enumerated in paragraph 2.1 hereof, which the Committee 
determines are consistent with the Plan's purpose; and (i) take any and all 
other action it deems necessary or advisable for the proper operation or 
administration of the Plan.  In addition, in order to enable Key Employees who 
are foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States or both to 
receive Awards under the Plan, the Committee may adopt such amendments, 
procedures, regulations, subplans and the like as are necessary or advisable, 
in the opinion of the Committee, to effectuate the purposes of the Plan.  The 
Committee shall also have the authority to grant Awards in replacement of 
Awards previously granted under this Plan or any other executive compensation 
plan of the Company or a Subsidiary.  All determinations of the Committee 
shall be made by a majority of its members, and its determinations shall be 
final, binding and conclusive.

The Committee, in its discretion, may delegate its authority and duties under 
the Plan to the Chief Executive Officer and/or to other senior officers of the 
Company under such conditions and/or limitations as the Committee may 
establish; provided, however, that only the Committee may select and grant 
Awards to Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.


4.   Eligibility

Any Key Employee is eligible to become a Participant of the Plan.

In addition, any individual who on the effective date of the Plan is both (i) 
a former Key Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, and (ii) a participant 
under the Eastman Kodak Company 1985 Long-Term Performance Award Plan (the 
"1985 Plan"), shall be eligible to become a Participant of the Plan.  However, 
the participation of any such individual under the Plan shall be limited 
solely to receiving Awards granted by the Committee under this Plan in 
replacement of any unpaid or unearned award under the 1985 Plan on the 
effective date of the Plan.

5. Shares Available

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock, $2.50 par value per share, of 
the Company which shall be available for grant of Awards under the Plan 
(including incentive stock options) during its term shall not exceed 
Twenty-Two Million Thirty-Three Thousand and Six Hundred (22,033,600).  (Such 
amount shall be subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 18.)  Any 
shares of Common Stock related to Awards which terminate by expiration, 
forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of such shares, are 
settled in cash in lieu of Common Stock, or are exchanged with the Committee's 
permission for Awards not involving Common Stock, shall be available again for 
grant under the Plan.  Further, any shares of Common Stock which are used by a 
Participant for the full or partial payment to the Company of the purchase 
price of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of a stock option, or for any 
withholding taxes due as a result of such exercise, shall again be available 
for Awards under the Plan.  Similarly, shares of Common Stock with respect to 
which an SAR has been exercised and paid in cash shall again be eligible for 
grant under the Plan.  The shares of Common Stock available for issuance under 
the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.


6. Term

The Plan shall become effective as of February 1, 1990, subject to its 
approval by the Company's shareholders at the 1990 annual meeting.  No awards 
shall be exercisable or payable before approval of the Plan has been obtained 
from the Company's shareholders.  Awards shall not be granted pursuant to the 
Plan after January 31, 1995.


7. Participation

The Committee shall select, from time to time, Participants from those Key 
Employees who, in the opinion of the Committee, can further the Plan's 
purposes.  Once a Participant is so selected, the Committee shall determine 
the type or types of Awards to be made to the Participant and shall establish 
in the related Award Notices the terms, conditions, restrictions and/or 
limitations, if any, applicable to the Awards in addition to those set forth 
in this Plan and the administrative rules and regulations issued by the 
Committee.
 

8. Stock Options

   (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of stock options.  These 
        stock options may be incentive stock options within the meaning of 
        Section 422A of the Code or non-qualified stock options (i.e., stock 
        options which are not incentive stock options), or a combination of 
        both.

   (b)  Terms and Conditions of Options.  An option shall be exercisable in 
        whole or in such installments and at such times as may be determined 
        by the Committee.  The price at which Common Stock may be purchased 
        upon exercise of a stock option shall be established by the Committee, 
        but such price shall not be less than 50 percent of the fair market 
        value of the Common Stock, as determined by the Committee, on the date 
        of the stock option's grant.
<PAGE>
                                                              <PAGE> 107

   (c)  Restrictions Relating to Incentive Stock Options.  Stock options 
        issued in the form of incentive stock options shall, in addition to 
        being subject to all applicable terms, conditions, restrictions and/or 
        limitations established by the Committee, comply with Section 422A of 
        the Code.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair market value (determined at 
        the time the option was granted) of the Common Stock with respect to 
        which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by a 
        Participant during any calendar year (under this Plan or any other 
        plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) shall not exceed 
        $100,000 (or such other limit as may be required by the Code).  
        Further, the per-share option price of an incentive stock option shall 
        not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the Common 
        Stock, as determined by the Committee, on the date of grant.  Also, 
        each option shall expire not later than ten years from its date of 
        grant.  The number of shares of Common Stock that shall be available 
        for incentive stock options granted under the Plan is 16,000,000.

   (d)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
        Award Notice or otherwise, establish such other terms, conditions, 
        restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any stock option Award, 
        provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan.

   (e)  Exercise.  Upon exercise, the option price of a stock option may be 
        paid in cash, shares of Common Stock, shares of restricted Common 
        Stock, a combination of the foregoing, or such other consideration as 
        the Committee may deem appropriate.  The Committee shall establish 
        appropriate methods for accepting Common Stock, whether restricted or 
        unrestricted, and may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate 
        on the use of such Common Stock to exercise a stock option.


9. Stock Appreciation Rights

   (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of stock appreciation 
        rights ("SARs").  An SAR may be granted in tandem with all or a 
        portion of a related stock option under the Plan ("Tandem SARs"), or 
        may be granted separately ("Freestanding SARs").  A Tandem SAR may be 
        granted either at the time of the grant of the related stock option or 
        at any time thereafter during the term of the stock option.  SARs 
        shall entitle the recipient to receive a payment equal to the 
        appreciation in market value of a stated number of shares of Common 
        Stock from the exercise price to the market value on the date of 
        exercise.  In the case of SARs granted in tandem with stock options 
        granted prior to the grant of such SARs, the appreciation in value is 
        from the option price of such related stock option to the market value 
        on the date of exercise.

   (b)  Terms and Conditions of Tandem SARs.  A Tandem SAR shall be 
        exercisable to the extent, and only to the extent, that the related 
        stock option is exercisable, and the "exercise price" of such an SAR 
        (the base from which the value of the SAR is measured at its exercise) 
        shall be the option price under the related stock option.  However, at 
        no time shall a Tandem SAR be issued if the option price of its 
        related stock option is less than 50 percent of the fair market value 
        of the Common Stock, as determined by the Committee, on the date of 
        the Tandem SAR's grant.  If a related stock option is exercised as to 
        some or all of the shares covered by the Award, the related Tandem 
        SAR, if any, shall be cancelled automatically to the extent of the 
        number of shares covered by the stock option exercise.  Upon exercise 
        of a Tandem SAR as to some or all of the shares covered by the Award, 
        the related stock option shall be cancelled automatically to the 
        extent of the number of shares covered by such exercise, and such 
        shares shall again be eligible for grant in accordance with paragraph 
        5 hereof, except to the extent any shares of Common Stock are issued 
        to settle the SAR.

   (c)  Terms and Conditions of Freestanding SARs.  Freestanding SARs shall be 
        exercisable in whole or in such installments and at such times as may 
        be determined by the Committee.  The exercise price of a Freestanding 
        SAR shall also be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that 
        such price shall not be less than 50 percent of the fair market value 
        of the Common Stock, as determined by the Committee, on the date of 
        the Freestanding SAR's grant.

   (d)  Deemed Exercise.  The Committee may provide that an SAR shall be 
        deemed to be exercised at the close of business on the scheduled 
        expiration date of such SAR if at such time the SAR by its terms 
        remains exercisable and, if so exercised, would result in a payment to 
        the holder of such SAR.

   (e)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
        Award Notice or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, 
        restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any SAR Award, provided 
        they are not inconsistent with the Plan.


10.     Stock Awards

   (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of Stock Awards.  Stock 
        Awards shall be awarded in such numbers and at such times during the 
        term of the Plan as the Committee shall determine.

   (b)  Award Restrictions.  Stock Awards shall be subject to such terms, 
        conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, as the Committee 
        deems appropriate including, but not by way of limitation, 
        restrictions on transferability and continued employment.  The 
        Committee may modify or accelerate the delivery of a Stock Award under 
        such circumstances as it deems appropriate.

   (c)  Rights as Shareholders.  During the period in which any restricted 
        shares of Common Stock are subject to the restrictions imposed under 
        paragraph 10(b), the Committee may, in its discretion, grant to the 
        Participant to whom such restricted shares have been awarded all or 
        any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such shares, 
        including, but not by way of limitation, the right to vote such shares 
        and to receive dividends.

   (d)  Evidence of Award.  Any stock award granted under the Plan may be 
        evidenced in such manner as the Committee deems appropriate, 
        including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of 
        a stock certificate or certificates.


11.     Performance Units

<PAGE>
                                                              <PAGE> 109

   (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of performance units.  
        Performance units, as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer to 
        Units valued by reference to designated criteria established by the 
        Committee, other than Common Stock.

   (b)  Performance Criteria.  Performance units shall be contingent on the 
        attainment during a performance period of certain performance 
        objectives.  The length of the performance period, the performance 
        objectives to be achieved during the performance period, and the 
        measure of whether and to what degree such objectives have been 
        attained shall be conclusively determined by the Committee in the 
        exercise of its absolute discretion.  Performance objectives may be 
        revised by the Committee, at such times as it deems appropriate during 
        the performance period, in order to take into consideration any 
        unforeseen events or changes in circumstances.

   (c)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
        Award Notice or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, 
        restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of performance 
        units, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan.


12.     Performance Shares

   (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of performance shares.  
        Performance shares, as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer to 
        shares of Common Stock or Units which are expressed in terms of Common 
        Stock.

   (b)  Performance Criteria.  Performance shares shall be contingent upon the 
        attainment during a performance period of certain performance 
        objectives.  The length of the performance period, the performance 
        objectives to be achieved during the performance period, and the 
        measure of whether and to what degree such objectives have been 
        attained shall be conclusively determined by the Committee in the 
        exercise of its absolute discretion.  Performance objectives may be 
        revised by the Committee, at such times as it deems appropriate during 
        the performance period, in order to take into consideration any 
        unforeseen events or changes in circumstances.

   (c)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
        Award Notice or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, 
        restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of performance 
        shares, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan.


13.     Payment of Awards

At the discretion of the Committee, payment of Awards may be made in cash, 
Common Stock, a combination of cash and Common Stock, or any other form of 
property as the Committee shall determine.  In addition, payment of Awards may 
include such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as 
the Committee deems appropriate, including, in the case of Awards paid in the 
form of Common Stock, restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provisions.  
Further, payment of Awards may be made in the form of a lump sum or 
installments, as determined by the Committee.

<PAGE>
                                                              <PAGE> 110
14.     Dividends and Dividend Equivalents

If an Award is granted in the form of a Stock Award, stock option, or 
performance share, or in the form of any other stock-based grant, the 
Committee may choose, at the time of the grant of the Award or any time 
thereafter up to the time of the Award's payment, to include as part of such 
Award an entitlement to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, subject to 
such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as the 
Committee may establish.  Dividends and dividend equivalents shall be paid in 
such form and manner (i.e., lump sum or installments), and at such time as the 
Committee shall determine.  All dividends or dividend equivalents which are 
not paid currently may, at the Committee's discretion, accrue interest, be 
reinvested into additional shares of Common Stock or, in the case of dividends 
or dividend equivalents credited in connection with performance shares, be 
credited as additional performance shares and paid to the Participant if and 
when, and to the extent that, payment is made pursuant to such Award.

15.     Deferral of Awards

At the discretion of the Committee, payment of a Stock Award, performance 
share, performance unit, dividend, dividend equivalent, or any portion thereof 
may be deferred by a Participant until such time as the Committee may 
establish.  All such deferrals shall be accomplished by the delivery of a 
written, irrevocable election by the Participant prior to the time such 
payment would otherwise be made, on a form provided by the Company.  Further, 
all deferrals shall be made in accordance with administrative guidelines 
established by the Committee to ensure that such deferrals comply with all 
applicable requirements of the Code and its regulations.  Deferred payments 
shall be paid in a lump sum or installments, as determined by the Committee.  
The Committee may also credit interest, at such rates to be determined by the 
Committee, on cash payments that are deferred and credit dividends or dividend 
equivalents on deferred payments denominated in the form of Common Stock.

16.     Termination of Employment

If a Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates for 
a reason other than death, disability, retirement, or any approved reason, all 
unexercised, unearned, and/or unpaid Awards, including, but not by way of 
limitation, Awards earned but not yet paid, all unpaid dividends and dividend 
equivalents, and all interest accrued on the foregoing shall be cancelled or 
forfeited, as the case may be, unless the Participant's Award Notice provides 
otherwise.  The Committee shall have the authority to promulgate rules and 
regulations to 
(i) determine what events constitute disability, retirement, or termination 
for an approved reason for purposes of the Plan, and (ii) determine the 
treatment of a Participant under the Plan in the event of his death, 
disability, retirement or termination for an approved reason.  Anything herein 
to the contrary notwithstanding, Participants who cease to be employed by the 
Company or a Subsidiary and are employed by Eastman Chemical Company or one of 
its subsidiaries in connection with the distribution of the common stock of 
Eastman Chemical Company to the shareholders of the Company, shall not be 
deemed to have terminated employment for purposes of this Plan and all Awards 
outstanding on the date of such distribution.

17.     Nonassignability

No Awards or any other payment under the Plan shall be subject in any manner 
to alienation, anticipation, sale, transfer (except by will or the laws of 
descent and distribution), assignment, pledge, or encumbrance, nor shall any 
Award be payable to or exercisable by anyone other than the Participant to 
whom it was granted.

18.     Adjustment of Shares Available

If there is any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock 
through the declaration of stock dividends, stock splits or the like, the 
number of shares available for Awards, the shares subject to any Award and the 
option prices or exercise prices of Awards shall be automatically adjusted.  
If there is any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock 
through any change in the capital account of the Company, or through any other 
transaction referred to in Section 425(a) of the Code, the Committee shall 
make appropriate adjustments in the maximum number of shares of Common Stock 
which may be issued under the Plan and any adjustments and/or modifications to 
outstanding Awards as it deems appropriate.  In the event of any other change 
in the capital structure or in the Common Stock of the Company, the Committee 
shall also be authorized to make such appropriate adjustments in the maximum 
number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan and any 
adjustments and/or modifications to outstanding Awards as it deems 
appropriate.


19.     Withholding Taxes

The Company shall be entitled to deduct from any payment under the Plan, 
regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income 
and employment taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such 
payment or may require the Participant to pay to it such tax prior to and as a 
condition of the making of such payment.  In accordance with any applicable 
administrative guidelines it establishes, the Committee may allow a 
Participant to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld from an 
Award by withholding from any payment of Common Stock due as a result of such 
Award, or by permitting the Participant to deliver to the Company, shares of 
Common Stock having a fair market value, as determined by the Committee, equal 
to the amount of such required withholding taxes.


20.     Noncompetition Provision

Unless the Award Notice specifies otherwise, a Participant shall forfeit all 
unexercised, unearned, and/or unpaid Awards, including, but not by way of 
limitation, Awards earned but not yet paid, all unpaid dividends and dividend 
equivalents, and all interest, if any, accrued on the foregoing if, (i) in the 
opinion of the Committee, the Participant, without the written consent of the 
Company, engages directly or indirectly in any manner or capacity as 
principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, or otherwise, in any 
business or activity competitive with the business conducted by the Company or 
any Subsidiary; or (ii) the Participant performs any act or engages in any 
activity which in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is 
inimical to the best interests of the Company.  In addition, the Committee 
may, in its discretion, condition the deferral of any Award, dividend, or 
dividend equivalent under paragraph 15 hereof on a Participant's compliance 
with the terms of this paragraph 20, and cause such a Participant to forfeit 
any payment which is so deferred if the Participant fails to comply with the 
terms hereof.


21.     Amendments to Awards

The Committee may at any time unilaterally amend any unexercised, unearned, or 
unpaid Award, including, but not by way of limitation, Awards earned but not 
yet paid, to the extent it deems appropriate; provided, however, that any such 
amendment which, in the opinion of the Committee, is adverse to the 
Participant shall require the Participant's consent.
<PAGE>
                                                              <PAGE> 112

22.     Regulatory Approvals and Listings

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Company 
shall have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates of Common Stock 
evidencing Stock Awards or any other Award resulting in the payment of Common 
Stock prior to (a) the obtaining of any approval from any governmental agency 
which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or 
advisable, (b) the admission of such shares to listing on the stock exchange 
on which the Common Stock may be listed, and (c) the completion of any 
registration or other qualification of said shares under any state or federal 
law or ruling of any governmental body which the Company shall, in its sole 
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.


23.     No Right to Continued Employment or Grants

Participation in the Plan shall not give any Key Employee any right to remain 
in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary.  The Company or, in the case 
of employment with a Subsidiary, the Subsidiary, reserves the right to 
terminate any Key Employee at any time.  Further, the adoption of this Plan 
shall not be deemed to give any Key Employee or any other individual any right 
to be selected as a Participant or to be granted an Award.


24.     Amendment

The Benefit Plans Committee of the Company may suspend or terminate the Plan 
at any time.  In addition, the Benefit Plans Committee of the Company may, 
from time to time, amend the Plan in any manner, but may not without 
shareholder approval adopt any amendment which would (a) materially increase 
the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (b) materially increase 
the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan 
(except as specified in paragraph 18), or (c) materially modify the 
requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.


25.     Governing Law

The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
State of New York, except as superseded by applicable Federal Law.


26.     Change In Ownership

   (a)  Background.  Upon a Change In Ownership:  (i) the terms of this 
        paragraph 26 shall immediately become operative, without further 
        action or consent by any person or entity; (ii) all terms, conditions, 
        restrictions, and limitations in effect on any unexercised, unearned, 
        unpaid, and/or deferred Award, or any other outstanding Award, shall 
        immediately lapse as of the date of such event; (iii) no other terms, 
        conditions, restrictions and/or limitations shall be imposed upon any 
        Awards on or after such date, and in no circumstance shall an Award be 
        forfeited on or after such date; (iv) all unexercised, unvested, 
        unearned, and/or unpaid Awards or any other outstanding Awards shall 
        automatically become one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately.

   (b)  Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.  Upon a Change In Ownership, all 
        unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents and all interest accrued 
        thereon, if any, shall be treated and paid under this paragraph 26 in 
        the identical manner and time as the Award under which such dividends 
        or dividend equivalents have been credited.  For example, if upon a 
        Change In Ownership, an Award under this paragraph 26 is to be paid in 
        a prorated fashion, all unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents with 
        respect to such Award shall be paid according to the same formula used 
        to determine the amount of such prorated Award.

<PAGE> 113

   (c)  Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares.  If a Change In 
        Ownership occurs during the term of one or more performance periods 
        for which the Committee has granted performance units and/or 
        performance shares (hereinafter a "current performance period"), the 
        term of each such performance period shall immediately terminate upon 
        the occurrence of such event.  Upon a Change In Ownership, for each 
        "current performance period" and each completed performance period for 
        which the Committee has not on or before such date made a 
        determination as to whether and to what degree the performance 
        objectives for such period have been attained (hereinafter a 
        "completed performance period"), it shall be assumed that the 
        performance objectives have been attained at a level of one hundred 
        percent (100%) or the equivalent thereof.

        A Participant in one or more "current performance periods" shall be 
        considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive, a 
        prorated portion of the Awards previously granted to him for each such 
        performance period.  Such prorated portion shall be determined by 
        multiplying the number of performance shares or performance units, as 
        the case may be, granted to the Participant by a fraction, the 
        numerator of which is the total number of whole and partial years 
        (with each partial year being treated as a whole year) that have 
        elapsed since the beginning of the performance period, and the 
        denominator of which is the total number of years in such performance 
        period.


        A Participant in one or more "completed performance periods" shall be 
        considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive all 
        the performance shares or performance units, as the case may be, 
        previously granted to him during each such performance period.

   (d)  Valuation of Awards.  Upon a Change In Ownership, all outstanding 
        Units of Common Stock, Freestanding SARs, stock options (including 
        incentive stock options), and performance shares (including those 
        earned as a result of the application of paragraph 26(c) above) and 
        all other outstanding stock-based Awards, including those granted by 
        the Committee pursuant to its authority under paragraph 3(h) hereof, 
        shall be valued and cashed out on the basis of the Change In Control 
        Price.

   (e)  Payment of Awards.  Upon a Change In Ownership, any Participant, 
        whether or not he is still employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, 
        shall be paid, in a single lump-sum cash payment, as soon as 
        practicable but in no event later than 90 days after the Change In 
        Ownership, all of his outstanding Units of Common Stock, Freestanding 
        SARs, stock options (including incentive stock options), performance 
        units (including those earned as a result of the application of 
        paragraph 26(c) above), and performance shares (including those earned 
        as a result of paragraph 26(c) above), and all other outstanding 
        Awards, including those granted by the Committee pursuant to its 
        authority under paragraph 3(h) hereof.

   (f)  Deferred Awards.  Upon a Change In Ownership, all Awards deferred by a 
        Participant under paragraph 15 hereof, but for which he has not 
        received payment as of such date, shall be paid to him in a single 
        lump-sum cash payment as soon as practicable, but in no event later 
        than 90 days after the Change In Ownership.  For purposes of making 
        such payment, the value of all Awards which are stock based shall be 
        determined by the Change In Control Price.


   (g)  Section 16 of Exchange Act.  Notwithstanding anything contained in 
        this paragraph 26 to the contrary, any Participant who, on the date of 
        the Change In Ownership, holds any stock options or Freestanding SARs 
        that have not been outstanding for a period of at least six months 
        from their date of grant and who on such date is required to report 
        under Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall not be paid such Award 
        until the first day next following the end of such six-month period.

   (h)  Miscellaneous.  Upon a Change In Ownership, (i) the provisions of 
        paragraphs 16, 20 and 21 hereof shall become null and void and of no 
        further force and effect; and (ii) no action, including, but not by 
        way of limitation, the amendment, suspension, or termination of the 
        Plan, shall be taken which would affect the rights of any Participant 
        or the operation of the Plan with respect to any Award to which the 
        Participant may have become entitled hereunder on or prior to the date 
        of such action or as a result of such Change In Ownership.


27.     Change In Control.

   (a)  Background.  All Participants shall be eligible for the treatment 
        afforded by this Paragraph 27 if their employment terminates within 
        two years following a Change In Control, unless the termination is due 
        to (i) death, (ii) disability entitling the Participant to benefits 
        under his employer's long-term disability plan, (iii) Cause, (iv) 
        resignation other than (A) resignation from a declined reassignment to 
        a job that is not reasonably equivalent in responsibility or 
        compensation (as defined in the Company's Termination Allowance Plan), 
        or that is not in the same geographic area (as defined in the 
        Company's Termination Allowance Plan), or (B) resignation within 
        thirty days following a reduction in base pay, or (v) retirement 
        entitling the Participant to benefits under his employer's retirement 
        plan.

   (b)  Vesting and Lapse of Restrictions.  If a Participant is eligible for 
        treatment under this paragraph 27, (i) all of the terms, conditions, 
        restrictions, and limitations in effect on any of his unexercised, 
        unearned, unpaid and/or deferred Awards shall immediately lapse as of 
        the date of his termination of employment; (ii) no other terms, 
        conditions, restrictions and/or limitations shall be imposed upon any 
        of his Awards on or after such date, and in no event shall any of his 
        Awards be forfeited on or after such date; and (iii) all of his 
        unexercised, unvested, unearned and/or unpaid Awards shall 
        automatically become one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately 
        upon his termination of employment.

   (c)  Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.  If a Participant is eligible for 
        treatment under this paragraph 27, all of his unpaid dividends and 
        dividend equivalents and all interest accrued thereon, if any, shall 
        be treated and paid under this Paragraph 27 in the identical manner 
        and time as the Award under which such dividends or dividend 
        equivalents have been credited.

   (d)  Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares.  If a 
        Participant holding either performance units or performance shares is 
        terminated under the conditions described in (a) above, the provisions 
        of this paragraph (d) shall determine the manner in which such 
        performance units and/or performance shares shall be paid to him.  For 
        purposes of making such payment, each "current performance period," as 
        that term is defined in paragraph 26(c) hereof, shall be treated as 
        terminating upon the date of the Participant's termination of 
        employment, and for each such "current performance period" and each 
        "completed performance period," as that term is defined in paragraph 
        26(c) hereof, it shall be assumed that the performance objectives have 
        been attained at a level of one hundred percent (100%) or the 
        equivalent thereof.  If the Participant is participating in one or 
        more "current performance periods," he shall be considered to have 
        earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive that prorated portion of 
        the Awards previously granted to him for each such performance period, 
        as determined in accordance with the formula established in paragraph 
        26(c) hereof.  A Participant in one or more "completed performance 
        periods" shall be considered to have earned and, therefore, be 
        entitled to receive all the performance shares and performance units 
        previously granted to him during each performance period.

   (e)  Valuation of Awards.  If a Participant is eligible for treatment under 
        this paragraph 27, his Awards shall be valued and cashed out in 
        accordance with the provisions of paragraph 26(d) hereof.

   (f)  Payment of Awards.  If a Participant is eligible for treatment under 
        this paragraph 27, he shall be paid, in a single lump-sum cash 
        payment, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 90 days 
        after the date of his termination of employment, all of his 
        outstanding Units of Common Stock, Freestanding SARs, stock options 
        (including incentive stock options), performance units (including 
        those earned as a result of the application of paragraph 27(d) above), 
        and performance shares (including those earned as a result of 
        paragraph 27(d) above), and all of his other outstanding Awards, 
        including those granted by the Committee pursuant to its authority 
        under paragraph 3(h) hereof.

   (g)  Deferred Awards.  If a Participant is eligible for treatment under 
        this paragraph 27, all of his deferred Awards for which he has not 
        received payment as of the date of his termination of employment shall 
        be paid to him in a single lump-sum cash payment as soon as 
        practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the date of his 
        termination. For purposes of making such payment, the value of all 
        Awards which are stock based shall be determined by the Change In 
        Control Price.

   (h)  Section 16 of Exchange Act.  Notwithstanding anything contained in 
        this paragraph 27 to the contrary, any Participant who, on the date of 
        his termination of employment under the conditions described in 
        subparagraph (a) above, holds any stock options or Freestanding SARs 
        that have not been outstanding for a period of at least six months 
        from their date of grant and who on the date of such termination is 
        required to report under Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall not be 
        paid such Award until the first day next following the end of such 
        six-month period.

   (i)  Miscellaneous.  Upon a Change In Control, (i) the provisions of 
        paragraphs 16, 20 and 21 hereof shall become null and void and of no 
        force and effect insofar as they apply to a Participant who has been 
        terminated under the conditions described in (a) above; and (ii) no 
        action, including, but not by way of limitation, the amendment, 
        suspension or termination of the Plan, shall be taken which would 
        affect the rights of any Participant or the operation of the Plan with 
        respect to any Award to which the Participant may have become entitled 
        hereunder on or prior to the date of the Change In Control or to which 
        he may become entitled as a result of such Change In Control.

   (j)  Legal Fees.  The Company shall pay all legal fees and related expenses 
        incurred by a Participant in seeking to obtain or enforce any payment, 
        benefit or right he may be entitled to under the Plan after a Change 
        In Control; provided, however, the Participant shall be required to 
        repay any such amounts to the Company to the extent a court of 
        competent jurisdiction issues a final and non-appealable order setting 
        forth the determination that the position taken by the Participant was 
        frivolous or advanced in bad faith.


28.     No Right, Title, or Interest in Company Assets

No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder as a result of 
participation in the Plan until the date of issuance of a stock certificate in 
his name, and, in the case of restricted shares of Common Stock, such rights 
are granted to the Participant under paragraph 10(c) hereof.  To the extent 
any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under this 
Plan, such rights shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured creditor 
of the Company.


29.     Gender

Throughout this Plan, the masculine gender shall include the feminine.

January 3, 1995


TO:  Wilbur J. Prezzano

Dear Bill:

This letter is intended to confirm the following:

1. As of the date set forth above, the letter agreement between you and Kodak 
   dated September 3, 1993 remains in effect.

2. Any Kodak retirement benefits for which you would qualify if you had 
   retired in 1994 will be provided to you if and when you retire from Kodak.  
   However, with respect to your retiree health and dental benefits, specific 
   provision must be made to protect such benefits in the event the coverage 
   you would have received had you retired in 1994  is not being provided by 
   the Company at the time of or during your retirement.  In such event, you 
   will receive that health and dental coverage that is then being provided by 
   the Company which, in terms of both its benefits and required participant 
   contributions, is most comparable to the company provided coverage you 
   would have received had you retired in 1994.

3. With regards to your expenses while traveling for Kodak, you are authorized 
   to incur reasonable travel and lodging expenses for yourself and, in those 
   situations you deem appropriate, your wife for purposes of carrying out 
   your duties and responsibilities for the Company.  Kodak will reimburse you 
   for such expenses, subject to documentation in accordance with Kodak 
   policy.

Please indicate your acceptance of the terms set forth in this letter by 
signing the attached duplicate original and returning the same to my 
attention.

       (b)   Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing shall

Agreement.


   4.   Base Salary.

      The Executive shall be paid an annualized Base Salary, payable in 
accordance with the regular payroll practices of the Company, of $550,000.  
The Base Salary shall be reviewed no less frequently than annually for 
increase in the discretion of the Board and its Executive Compensation and 
Development Committee (the "Committee").


   5.   Annual Incentive Awards.

      The Executive shall participate in all annual incentive award programs 
maintained by the Company for its senior level executives or its employees 
generally, including, without limitation, the following:

      (a)   The Company's Management Annual Performance Plan.  The Executive 
shall have an annual target award opportunity under such plan of at least 
$330,000.  With regard to the Award for 1994 performance, payable in April of 
1995 (the "1994 Performance Award"), the Executive shall receive a minimum 
guaranteed payment of $330,000. 
 In the event, however, that the 1994 Performance Award that the Executive is 
awarded exceeds $330,000, the Performance Award that will be paid to him shall 
be an amount equal to the sum of $330,000 plus an amount determined by 
multiplying the amount by which the Performance Award exceeds $330,000 by a 
fraction the numerator of which shall be the total number of days that the 
Executive is employed by the Company during 1994 and the denominator of which 
is 365.

      (b)   The Company's Wage Dividend.  For the purposes of the Wage 
Dividend, he shall be deemed to have at least five years of service.  However, 
for purposes of the 1994 Wage Dividend payable in March of 1995, the 
Executive's Wage Dividend Base shall not include his entire Base Salary, but 
only that portion of the Base Salary which is actually paid to him during 
1994, regardless of whether he elects to receive or defer such amount or parts 
thereof.

      Payment of annual incentive awards shall be made at the same time that 
other senior-level executives receive their annual incentive awards.

   6.   Long-Term Incentive Programs.
   
      (a)   General.  Except as otherwise stated in this Section 6, the 
Executive shall be eligible to participate in the long-term incentive programs 
of the Company on the same basis as other senior-level executives of the 
Company.

      (b)   Restricted Stock Award.  As soon as practicable after commencement 
of the Executive's employment, the Company shall grant the Executive 
restricted shares of Stock substantially in the form attached to the Agreement 
as Exhibit A, such shares of Stock to be subject to forfeiture in their 
entirety if the Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Section 11(c) or 
11(e) below prior to the end of the Term of Employment.  The number of shares 
of restricted Stock to be granted to the Executive shall be determined by 
dividing $550,000 by the fair market value of a share of Stock on the date the 
restricted stock is granted.  Fair market value shall be determined by taking 
the mean between the high and low at which the Stock trades on the New York 
Stock Exchange on the date the restricted stock is granted.

      (c)   Stock Option Award.  As soon as practicable after commencement of 
the Executive's employment, the Company shall grant the Executive a 10-year 
option, substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B, to 
purchase 200,000 shares of Stock (the "Option"), such option to become 
exercisable on February 10, 1999 and to be subject to forfeiture in its 
entirety if the Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Section 11(c) or 
11(e) below prior to such date.  The exercise price (per share) of the option 
shall be the fair market value of a share of Stock on the date of the option's 
grant.  Fair market value shall be determined by taking the mean between the 
high and low at which the Stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date of the option's grant.

      (d)   1993-1995 Restricted Stock Subplan.  As soon as practicable after 
the commencement of the Executive's employment, the Executive shall become a 
Participant of the Company's 1993-1995 Restricted Stock Subplan (the 
"Subplan").  The Award that the Executive shall be eligible to receive under 
the Subplan shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the Award that 
the Executive would have been eligible to receive had he been a Participant in 
the Subplan since its establishment by a fraction the numerator of which shall 
be the number of days that the Executive is employed by the Company during the 
Subplan's Award Period and the denominator of which is the total number of 
days in the Award Period.  To the extent the Committee elects to grant Awards 
under the Subplan, the Award that the Executive would otherwise receive under 
the Subplan shall be reduced by the number of shares of Stock granted to the 
Executive under Section 6(b) above.

   7.   Employee Benefit Programs.

      (a)   In General.  During the Term of Employment, the Executive shall be 
entitled to participate in all employee pension and welfare benefit plans and 
programs made available to the Company's senior level executives or to its 
employees generally, as such plans or programs may be in effect from time to 
time, including, without limitation, pension, profit sharing, savings and 
other retirement plans or programs, medical, dental, hospitalization, 
short-term and long-term disability and life insurance plans, accidental death 
and dismemberment protection, travel accident insurance, and any other pension 
or retirement plans or programs and any other employee welfare benefit plans 
or programs that may be sponsored by the Company from time to time, including 
any plans that supplement the above-listed types of plans or programs, whether 
funded or unfunded.

      (b)   Vacation.  The Executive will be entitled to six weeks paid 
vacation per year.  However, for purposes of calendar 1994, the six weeks of 
paid vacation will be prorated based on the number of days the Executive is 
employed by the Company during such year.

      (c)   Service.  To the extent there is a period of employment required 
as a condition for full benefit coverage under any employee benefit program, 
the Executive shall be deemed to have met such requirement.  For purposes of 
the Company's Short-Term Disability Plan, the Executive shall be deemed to 
have 15 years of service immediately upon his employment with the Company.  
For purposes of any retiree welfare benefits of the Company for which the 
Executive may become eligible, the Executive's actual years of service with 
the Company will be used to determine his entitlement to any such benefit and 
he shall not be deemed to have completed any years of service with the Company 
in addition to his actual years of service for this purpose.


   8.   Supplemental Pension.

      (a)   The Executive shall be eligible to receive a pension benefit to be 
determined in accordance with the terms of the Kodak Retirement Income Plan 
("KRIP")and supplements thereto as in effect on the date of this Agreement, 
subject to the terms of this Section 8 and adjustment for any future 
enhancements to KRIP and supplements thereto.  For purposes of this Section 8, 
"supplements thereto" shall include the Kodak Excess Retirement Income Plan.

      (b)   For purposes of establishing (i) the total amount of "Accrued 
Service" used to calculate the Executive's retirement and pre-retirement 
survivor income benefits under KRIP, (ii) the Executive's "Total Service" for 
purposes of determining the applicability of the early retirement reduction 
factor contained in Section 5.02(b)(2) of KRIP (i.e., the 75/85 rule), and 
(iii) the Executive's "Vesting Service" for purposes of Section 7.02 of KRIP, 
Executive shall be credited with six years of service (one year of actual 
service and five years of additional, deemed service) for each year of service 
earned under the terms of KRIP.  (In the event of a sixth year of employment, 
the Executive should be credited with two more years of additional, deemed 
service, bringing the Executive's total years of service to 32.)

      (c)   The retirement and pre-retirement survivor income benefits 
provided under this Section 8 shall be reduced by any benefit for which the 
Executive or his survivors are eligible under any other Company pension plan 
or pension plan of a prior employer, whether or not qualified, providing 
deferred compensation or survivor benefits.  For purposes of determining such 
deduction, the amount of any benefit payable under any plan shall be 
calculated using, to the extent applicable, the same assumptions used to 
calculate benefits for the Executive or his survivors under KRIP and 
supplements thereto (e.g., frequency of payment, form of benefit, commencement 
date of payment, and, in the event the form of distribution is a lump sum, 
discount rate).

      (d)   The amount of the benefit, if any, payable to the Executive under 
the terms of this Section 8 shall be:  (i) paid in the same form and at the 
same time as the Executive's benefit under KRIP or, in the event the Executive 
is not entitled to any benefit under the terms of KRIP, as if the amount of 
the benefit under this Section 8 was payable under KRIP; and (ii) unless 
otherwise paid under KRIP, paid out of the Company's general assets and not 
funded in any manner, included in the Executive's gross income as ordinary 
income, subject to all income and payroll tax withholdings required to be made 
under applicable federal, state and local law or regulation, and not grossed 
up in order to keep the Executive whole.

purchase of a permanent residence in the Rochester, New York area and any 
moving expenses he incurs in moving his household goods from his present 
residence to such residence in Rochester.

      (c)   It is the intention of the Company that the Executive shall, after 
taking into account any taxes on a reimbursement or other benefit under 
Section 9(b), be kept whole with respect to such reimbursement or other 
benefit.  Accordingly, to the extent the Executive is taxable on any such 
reimbursement or benefit, the Company shall pay the Executive in connection 
therewith an amount which after all taxes incurred by the Executive on such 
amount shall equal the amount of the reimbursement or benefit being provided.


   10.   Perquisites.

      (a)   Fringe Benefits.  During the Term of Employment, the Executive 
shall be entitled to participate in any of the Company's executive fringe

Executive for the initiation fees he incurs in order to obtain membership in 
one country club and one luncheon club in the Rochester, New York area.  It is 
the intention of the Company that the Executive shall, after taking into 
account any taxes on a reimbursement under this Section 10(b), be kept whole 
with respect to such reimbursement. Accordingly, to the extent the Executive 
is taxable on any such reimbursement, the Company shall pay the Executive in 
connection therewith an amount which after all taxes incurred by the Executive 
on such amount shall equal the amount of the reimbursement being 
provided.

the Executive shall not disclose to anyone or make use of any trade secret or 
proprietary or confidential information of the Company, including such trade 
secret or proprietary or confidential information of any customer or other 
entity to which the Company owes an obligation not to disclose such 
information, which he acquires during the Term of Employment, including but 
not limited to records kept in the ordinary course of business, except (i) as 
such disclosure or use may be required or appropriate in connection with his

divulge, disclose or make accessible such information.

      (b)  Assignment of Rights.  The Executive hereby sells, assigns and 
transfers to the Company all of his right, title and interest in and to all 
inventions, discoveries, improvements and copyrightable subject matter (the 
"rights") which during the Term of Employment are made or conceived by him, 
alone or with others and which are within or arise out of any general field of 
the Company's business or arise out of any work he performs or information he 
receives regarding the business of the Company while employed by the Company.  
The Executive shall fully disclose to the Company as promptly as available all 
information known or possessed by him concerning the rights referred to in the 
preceding sentence, and upon request by the Company and without any further 
remuneration in any form to him by the Company, but at the expense of the 
Company, execute all applications for patents and for copyright registration, 
assignments thereof and other instruments and do all things which the Company 
may deem necessary to vest and maintain in it the entire right, title and 
interest in and to all such rights.

      (c)   Non-Competition.  The Executive understands and agrees 
that by virtue of his employment by the Company as its Chief Financial Officer

proprietary information about the Company's, including its subsidiaries and 
affiliated companies, current and future business policies, accounts, 
suppliers, customers, technology, procedures and methods of operation all of 
which the Executive agrees are confidential and the sole and exclusive 
property of the Company.

      The Parties agree that the Company would suffer great loss and damage if 
either during the Term of Employment or the two year period immediately 
following the termination of the Executive's employment for whatever reason, 
the Executive were to become employed by, provide services to, serve a 
director, consultant, advisor or in any other capacity render advice or 
services to a competitor of the Company, including a competitor of a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or a competitor of any entity in which 
the Company holds a fifty percent or greater interest.

and future anticipated activities of the Company.

      The provisions and limitation of this Section 12(c) shall apply on a 
worldwide basis.


   13.   Indemnification.

      (a)  The Company agrees that if the Executive is made a party, or is 
threatened to be made a party, to any action, suit or proceeding, whether 
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason 
of the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company 
or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, 
member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, 
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit 
plans, whether or not the basis of such Proceeding is the Executive's alleged 
action in an official capacity while serving as a director, officer, member, 
employee or agent, the Executive shall be indemnified and held harmless by the 
Company to the fullest extent legally permitted or authorized by the Company's 
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or resolutions of the Company's Board 
of Directors or, if greater, by the laws of the State of New Jersey, against 
all cost, expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, 
attorney's fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts 
paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by the 
Executive in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as 
to the Executive even if he has ceased to be a director, member, employee or 
agent of the Company or other entity and shall inure to the benefit of the 
Executive's heirs, executors and administrators.  The Company shall advance to 
the Executive all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by him in connection 
with a Proceeding within 20 days after receipt by the Company of a written 
request for such advance and a reasonably detailed description of such costs 
and expenses.  Such request shall include an undertaking by the Executive to 
repay the amount of such advance if it shall ultimately be determined that he 
is not entitled to be indemnified against such costs and expenses.

      (b)  The Company agrees to continue and maintain a directors and 
officers' liability insurance policy covering the Executive to the extent the 
Company provides such coverage for its other executive officers.

obligations may be assigned or transferred pursuant to a merger or

liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company hereunder.  No rights or 
obligations of the Executive under this Agreement may be assigned or 
transferred by the Executive other than his rights to compensation and 
benefits, which may be transferred only by will or operation of law, except as 
provided in Section 21 below.

   Exhibit A



NOTICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK
GRANTED [date] PURSUANT TO EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1990 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM 
COMPENSATION PLAN
("Grant Notice")




To:   

   You are granted [      ] shares of Eastman Kodak Company Common Stock (the 
"Restricted Shares").  The Restricted Shares are granted under the Eastman 
Kodak Company 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan (the "Plan") and are 
subject to the terms of the Plan and the following conditions:

   1.   The Restricted Shares awarded hereunder shall be promptly issued and a 
certificate(s) for such shares shall be issued in your name.  You shall 
thereupon be a shareholder of all the shares represented by the 
certificate(s).  As such, you shall have all the rights of a shareholder with 
respect to such shares, including, but not limited to, the right to vote such 
shares and to receive all dividends and other distributions(subject to 
Paragraph 2 below) paid with respect to them, provided, however, that the 
shares shall be subject to the restrictions in Paragraph 4 below.  The stock 
certificates representing such shares shall be imprinted with a legend stating 
that the shares represented thereby are Restricted Shares subject to the terms 
and conditions of this Grant Notice and, as such, may not be sold, exchanged, 
transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except in 
accordance with the terms of this Grant Notice.  Each transfer agent for the 
Common Stock shall be instructed to like effect in respect of such shares.  In 
aid of such  restrictions, you shall immediately upon receipt of the 
certificate(s) therefor, deposit such certificate(s) together with a stock 
power or other like instrument of transfer, appropriately endorsed in blank, 
with an escrow agent designated by the Committee, which may be the Company, 
under a deposit agreement containing such terms and conditions as the 
Committee shall approve, the expenses of such escrow to be borne by the 
Company.
 
   2.   If under Section 18 of the Plan, entitled "Adjustment of Available 
Shares," you, as the owner of the Restricted Shares, shall be entitled to new, 
additional or different shares of stock or securities,  the certificate or 
certificates for, or other evidences of, such new, additional or different 
shares or securities, together with a stock power or other instrument of 
transfer appropriately endorsed, shall be imprinted with a legend as provided 
in Paragraph 1 above, deposited by you under the deposit agreement provided 
for therein, and subject to the restrictions provided for in Paragraph 4 
below.

   3.   The term "Restricted Period" with respect to the Restricted Shares 
shall mean the period beginning on February 11, 1994 and ending 
on February 10, 1999.

   4.   During the Restricted Period, none of the Restricted Shares shall be 
sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of 
except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any attempt by you to 
dispose of your shares in any such manner shall result in the immediate 
forfeiture of such shares and any other shares then held by the designated 
escrow agent on your behalf.

   5.   If your employment is terminated pursuant to Section 11(c)
or 11(e) of the Employment Agreement between you and the Company dated 
February 11, 1994 (the "Employment Agreement") at any time before the 
Restricted Period ends, you shall immediately forfeit all of the Restricted 
Shares then held on your behalf by the designated escrow agent.

   6.   If your employment is terminated pursuant to Section 11(a) 
or 11(b) of the Employment Agreement, at any time before the Restricted Period 
ends, the restrictions set forth in Paragraph 4 above shall lapse as to that 
number of shares determined by multiplying [      ] shares (subject to 
adjustment as provided in Section 18 of the Plan) by a fraction, the numerator 
of which shall be the number of months during the Restricted Period you have 
been employed (including the month of termination) and the denominator of 
which shall be 60 months.  You 
shall immediately forfeit all remaining Restricted Shares.

   7.   If your employment is terminated pursuant to Section 11(d)  of the 
Employment Agreement, at any time before the Restricted Period ends, the 
restriction set forth in Paragraph 4 above shall lapse as to that number of 
shares determined by multiplying [      ] shares (subject to adjustment as 
provided in Section 18 of the Plan) by a fraction, the numerator of which 
shall be the number of months during the Restricted Period you have been 
employed (including the month of termination) plus 18 months (but not to 
exceed 60 months) and the denominator of which shall be 60 months.  You shall 
immediately forfeit all remaining Restricted Shares.

   8.   If your employment continues through the Restricted Period, the 
restrictions set forth in Paragraph 4 above, with respect to the Restricted 
Shares shall lapse.

   9.   Section 20 of the Plan (noncompetition) shall not apply to this grant.

   10.   The Company, or the designated escrow agent at the request  of the 
Company, shall be entitled to deduct from the Restricted Shares the amount of 
all applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld unless you 
make other arrangements with the Company for the timely payment of such taxes.

option shall, to the extent not already exercisable, immediately become 
exercisable and vested as to 200,000 shares (subject to adjust as provided in

months.  You shall immediately forfeit your rights as to any shares subject to 
this option at the time of your termination that are not exercisable and

exercisable and vested at the time of your termination of employment shall

2 above, or, if sooner, the exercise of this option in full.

NOTICE OF AWARD OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS
FEBRUARY 15, 1994 PURSUANT TO THE EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1990 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM 
COMPENSATION PLAN




1.   Background.  Under Sections 8 of the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation 
     Plan (the "Plan"), the Compensation Committee may, among other things, 
     award non-qualified stock options of the Company's Common Stock to those 
     Key Employees as the Committee in its discretion may determine, subject 
     to such terms, conditions and restrictions as it deems appropriate.


2.   Award.  On February 15, 1994, the Committee granted to Harry L. Kavetas 
     (the "Participant") an Award of one hundred ninety seven thousand six 
     hundred and seventy two (197,672) non-qualified stock options of Common 
     Stock.  One option provides for the ability to purchase a single share of 
     Common Stock.  This Award is granted under the Plan, subject to the terms 
     and conditions of the Plan and those set forth in this Award Notice.

3.   Terms and Conditions of Non-Qualified Stock Options.  The following terms 
     and conditions shall apply to the Award of Non-Qualified Stock Options:

     (a)  Option Price.  The option price shall be Forty Two and 94/100 
          Dollars ($42.94).

     (b)  Duration of Option.  Each option shall expire at the close of 
          business on February 14, 2004, unless sooner terminated or exercised 
          in full in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Award 
          Notice and the Plan.

     (c)  Vesting of an Option.  The options shall vest and, therefore, become 
          exercisable on February 15, 1999.  The period between February 15, 
          1994 and February 15, 1999 shall be the "Restricted Period."

          Once vested, the options may be exercisable by the Participant 
          regardless of whether any other options he has been granted by the 
          Company remain exercisable.  Options may be exercised by written 
          notice to the Company stating the number of shares with respect to 
          which the option is being exercised.

     (d)  Payment of Option Price.  The option price for the shares for which 
          an option is exercised by the Participant shall be paid by the 
          Participant on the date the option is exercised in cash, in shares 
          of Common Stock owned by the Participant, or a combination of the 
          foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment of the 
          option price shall be valued at its "fair market value."  For 
          purposes of this subparagraph, "fair market value" shall mean the 
          opening price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on 
          the date of exercise; provided, however, if the Common Stock is not 
          traded on such date, then the opening price on the immediately 
          preceding date on which Common Stock is traded shall be used.

     (e)  Withholding.  The Participant may pay the amount of taxes required 
          to be withheld upon exercise of his options by (i) delivering a 
          check made payable to the Company; or (ii) delivering to the Company 
          at the time of such exercise shares of Common Stock having a "fair 
          market value," as determined in accordance with Paragraph "3(d)" 
          above, equal to the amount of such withholding taxes.

     (f)  Rights as a Shareholder.  The Participant shall not have any of the 
          rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock 
          covered by an option except to the extent one or more certificates 
          for such shares shall be delivered to him upon the exercise of such 
          option.
<PAGE>

     (g)  Broker Assisted Exercise.  Notwithstanding Paragraphs "3(d)" and 
          "3(e)" above to the contrary, the Participant may exercise any 
          option granted to him under this Award Notice by way of the 
          Company's broker-assisted stock option exercise program, to the 
          extent such program is available at the time of such exercise.  
          Pursuant to the terms of such program, the amount of any taxes 
          required to be withheld upon exercise of any options under the 
          program shall be paid in cash directly to the Company.


     (h)  Termination of Employment.  If the Participant's employment is 
          terminated pursuant to Section 11(c) or 11(e) of the Employment 
          Agreement between the Participant and the Company dated as of 
          February 11, 1994 (the "Employment Agreement") at any time before 
          the Restricted Period ends, the Participant shall immediately 
          forfeit the entire Award.

4.   Death/Disability.  Notwithstanding Paragraph "3(c)" above to the 
contrary, if the Participant's employment is terminated pursuant to Section 
11(a) or 11(b) of the Employment Agreement at any time before the Restricted 
Period ends, the Award shall, to the extent not already exercisable, 
immediately become exercisable and vested as to that number of non-qualified 
stock options determined by multiplying 197,672 options (subject to adjustment 
as provided in Section 18 of the Plan) by a fraction, the numerator of which 
shall be the number of months during the Restricted Period that the 
Participant was employed (including the month of termination) and the 
denominator of which shall be 60 months.  The Participant shall immediately 
forfeit his rights as to any options that are not exercisable and vested after 
applying the fraction described in the immediately preceding sentence.  The 
Participant's rights as to any options which are or become exercisable and 
vested at the time of his termination of employment shall continue to be 
exercisable until the scheduled expiration date under Paragraph "3(b)" above, 
or, if sooner, the exercise of the option in full.

5.   Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination.  Notwithstanding 
Paragraph "3(c)" above to the contrary, if the Participant's employment is 
terminated pursuant to Section 11(d) of the Employment Agreement at any time 
before the Restricted Period ends, the Award shall, to the extent not already 
exercisable, immediately become exercisable and vested as to that number of 
non-qualified stock options determined by multiplying 197,672 options (subject 
to adjustment as provided in Section 18 of the Plan) by a fraction, the 
numerator of which shall be the number of months during the Restricted Period 
that the Participant was employed (including the month of termination) plus an 
additional 18 months  (but not in the aggregate to exceed 60 months) and the 
denominator of which shall be 60 months.  The Participant shall immediately 
forfeit his rights as to any options that are not exercisable and vested after 
applying the fraction described in the immediately preceding sentence.  The 
Participant's rights as to any options which are or become exercisable and 
vested at the time of his termination of employment shall continue to be 
exercisable until the scheduled expiration date under Paragraph "3(b)" above, 
or, if sooner, the exercise of the option in full.

6.   Definitions.  Any defined term used in this Award Notice shall have the 
same meaning for purposes of this document as that ascribed to it under the 
terms of the Plan.

7.   Non-Assignability.  The Awards shall not in any manner be subject to 
alienation, anticipation, sale, transfer (except by will or the laws of 
descent and distribution), assignment, pledge or encumbrance.

8.   Noncompetition.  Section 20 of the Plan, entitled "Noncompetition 
Provision," shall not apply to this Award.

NOTICE OF AWARD OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS
FEBRUARY 15, 1994 PURSUANT TO THE EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1990 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM 
COMPENSATION PLAN




1.   Background.  Under Sections 8 of the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation 
     Plan (the "Plan"), the Compensation Committee may, among other things, 
     award Incentive Stock Options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the 
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, of the Company's Common Stock to those Key 
     Employees as the Committee in its discretion may determine, subject to 
     such terms, conditions and restrictions as it deems appropriate.


2.   Award.  On February 15, 1994, the Committee granted to Harry L. Kavetas 
     (the "Participant") an Award of two thousand three hundred and twenty 
     eight (2,328) incentive stock options of Common Stock.  One option 
     provides for the ability to purchase a single share of Common Stock.  
     This Award is granted under the Plan, subject to the terms and conditions 
     of the Plan and those set forth in this Award Notice.


3.   Terms and Conditions of Incentive Stock Options.  The following terms and 
     conditions shall apply to the Award of Incentive Stock Options:

     (a)  Option Price.  The option price shall be Forty Two and 94/100 
          Dollars ($42.94).

     (b)  Duration of Option.  Each option shall expire at the close of 
          business on February 14, 2004, unless sooner terminated or exercised 
          in full in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Award 
          Notice and the Plan.

     (c)  Vesting of an Option.  The options shall vest and, therefore, become 
          exercisable on February 15, 1999.  The period between February 15, 
          1994 and February 15, 1999 shall be the "Restricted Period".

          Once vested, the options may be exercisable by the Participant 
          regardless of whether any other options he has been granted by the 
          Company remain exercisable.  Options may be exercised by written 
          notice to the Company stating the number of shares with respect to 
          which the option is being exercised.

     (d)  Payment of Option Price.  The option price for the shares for which 
          an option is exercised by the Participant shall be paid by the 
          Participant on the date the option is exercised in cash, in shares 
          of Common Stock owned by the Participant, or a combination of the 
          foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment of the 
          option price shall be valued at its "fair market value".  For 
          purposes of this subparagraph, "fair market value" shall mean the 
          opening price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on 
          the date of exercise; provided, however, if the Common Stock is not 
          traded on such date, then the opening price on the immediately 
          preceding date on which Common Stock is traded shall be used.

     (e)  Withholding.  The Participant may pay the amount of taxes required 
          to be withheld upon exercise of his options by (i) delivering a 
          check made payable to the Company; or (ii) delivering to the Company 
          at the time of such exercise shares of Common Stock having a "fair 
          market value", as determined in accordance with Paragraph "3(d)" 
          above, equal to the amount of such withholding taxes.

     (f)  Rights as a Shareholder.  The Participant shall not have any of the 
          rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock 
          covered by an option except to the extent one or more certificates 
          for such shares shall be delivered to him upon the exercise of such 
          option.

     (g)  Termination of Employment.  If the Participant's employment is 
          terminated pursuant to Section 11(c) or 11(e) of the Employment 
          Agreement between the Participant and the Company dated as of 
          February 11, 1994 (the "Employment Agreement") at any time before 
          the Restricted Period ends, the Participant shall immediately 
          forfeit the entire Award.

4.   Death/Disability.  Notwithstanding Paragraph "3(c)" above to the 
     contrary, if the Participant's employment is terminated pursuant to 
     Section 11(a) or 11(b) of the Employment Agreement at any time before the 
     Restricted Period ends, the Award shall, to the extent not already 
     exercisable, immediately become exercisable and vested as to that number 
     of incentive stock options determined by multiplying 2,328 options 
     (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18 of the Plan) by a 
     fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of months during the 
     Restricted Period that the Participant was employed (including the month 
     of termination) and the denominator of which shall be 60 months.  The 
     Participant shall immediately forfeit his rights as to any options that 
     are not exercisable and vested after applying the fraction described in 
     the immediately preceding sentence.  The Participant's rights as to any 
     options which are or become exercisable and vested at the time of his 
     termination of employment shall continue to be exercisable until the 
     scheduled expiration date under Paragraph "3(b)" above, or, if sooner, 
     the exercise of the option in full.

5.   Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination.  Notwithstanding 
     Paragraph "3(c)" above to the contrary, if the Participant's employment 
     is terminated pursuant to Section 11(d) of the Employment Agreement at 
     any time before the Restricted Period ends, the Award shall, to the 
     extent not already exercisable, immediately become exercisable and vested 
     as to that number of incentive stock options determined by multiplying 
     2,328 options (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18 of the 
     Plan) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of months 
     during the Restricted Period that the Participant was employed (including 
     the month of termination) plus an additional 18 months  (but not in the 
     aggregate to exceed 60 months) and the denominator of which shall be 60 
     months.  The Participant shall immediately forfeit his rights as to any 
     options that are not exercisable and vested after applying the fraction 
     described in the immediately preceding sentence.  The Participant's 
     rights as to any options which are or become exercisable and vested at 
     the time of his termination of employment shall continue to be 
     exercisable until the scheduled expiration date under Paragraph "3(b)" 
     above, or, if sooner, the exercise of the option in full.

6.   Definitions.  Any defined term used in this Award Notice shall have the 
     same meaning for purposes of this document as that ascribed to it under 
     the terms of the Plan.

7.   Non-Assignability.  The Awards shall not in any manner be subject to 
     alienation, anticipation, sale, transfer (except by will or the laws of 
     descent and distribution), assignment, pledge or encumbrance.


8.   Noncompetition.  Section 20 of the Plan, entitled "Noncompetition 
     Provision", shall not apply to this Award.

9.   Compliance with Code Section 422.  The options granted by way of this 
     Award Notice are intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options under 
     Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  To the extent any 
     provision of this Award Notice is determined to be inconsistent or 
     contrary to Section 422, such provision shall be automatically changed, 
     effective as of the date of the options' grant, so as to be consistent 
     and in compliance with such section.

NOTICE OF AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS EFFECTIVE 
FEBRUARY 15, 1994 PURSUANT TO THE
EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1990 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM COMPENSATION PLAN




1.   Background.  Under Section 10 of the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation 
     Plan (the "Plan"), the Compensation Committee may, among other things, 
     award restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock to those Key 
     Employees as the Committee in its discretion may determine, subject to 
     such terms, conditions and restrictions as it deems appropriate.


2.   Award.  On February 15, 1994, the Committee granted, to Harry L. Kavetas 
     (the "Participant") an Award of twelve thousand eight hundred and ten 
     (12,810) restricted shares of Common Stock ("Restricted Shares").  This 
     Award is granted under the Plan, subject to the terms and conditions of 
     the Plan and those set forth in this Award Notice.


3.   Terms and Conditions of Restricted Shares.  The following terms and 
     conditions shall apply to Restricted Shares:

     (a)  Issuance.  The Restricted Shares awarded hereunder to the 
          Participant shall be promptly issued and a certificate(s) for such 
          shares shall be issued in the Participant's name.  The Participant 
          shall thereupon be a shareowner of all the shares represented by the 
          certificate(s).  As such, the Participant shall have all the rights 
          of a shareowner with respect to such shares, including but not 
          limited to, the right to vote such shares and to receive all 
          dividends and other distributions (subject to Paragraph " 3(b)") 
          paid with respect to them, provided, however, that the shares shall 
          be subject to the restrictions in Paragraph "3(d)".  The stock 
          certificates representing the Restricted Shares shall be imprinted 
          with a legend stating that the shares represented thereby are 
          restricted shares subject to the terms and conditions of this Award 
          Notice and, as such, may not be sold, exchanged, transferred, 
          pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of except in accordance 
          with this Award Notice.  Each transfer agent for the Common Stock 
          shall be instructed to like effect in respect of such shares.  In 
          aid of such restrictions, the Participant shall immediately upon 
          receipt of the certificate(s) therefor, deposit such certificate(s) 
          together with a stock power or other like instrument of transfer, 
          appropriately endorsed in blank, with an escrow agent designated by 
          the Committee, which may be the Company, under a deposit agreement 
          containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall approve, 
          the expenses of such escrow to be borne by the Company.

     (b)  Stock Splits, Dividends, etc.  If under Section "18" of the Plan, 
          entitled "Adjustment of Available Shares", the Participant, as the 
          owner of the Restricted Shares, shall be entitled to new, 
          additional, or different shares of stock or securities, the 
          certificate or certificates for, or other evidences of, such new, 
          additional, or different shares or securities, together with a stock 
          power or other instrument of transfer appropriately endorsed, shall 
          be imprinted with a legend as provided in Paragraph "3(a)" above, 
          deposited by the Participant under the deposit agreement provided 
          for therein, and subject to the restrictions provided for in 
          Paragraph "3(d)" below.

     (c)  Restricted Period.  The term "Restricted Period" with respect to the 
          Restricted Shares shall mean the period beginning on February 15, 
          1994 and ending on February 14, 1999.

     (d)  Restriction on Restricted Shares.  The restrictions to which the 
          Restricted Shares are subject are:

          (i)  Nonalienation.  During the Restricted Period, none of the 
               Restricted Shares shall be sold, exchanged, transferred, 
               pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of except by will 
               or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any attempt by the 
               Participant to dispose of his shares in any such manner shall 
               result in the immediate forfeiture of such shares and any other 
               shares then held by the designated escrow agent on the 
               Participant's behalf.

          (ii) Continuous Employment.  If the Participant's employment is 
               terminated pursuant to Section 11(c) or 11(e) of the Employment 
               Agreement between the Participant and the Company dated as of 
               February 11, 1994 (the "Employment Agreement") at any time 
               before the Restriction Period ends, he shall immediately 
               forfeit all of the Restricted Shares then held on his behalf by 
               the designated escrow agent.

     (e)  Lapse of Restrictions.  The restrictions set forth in Paragraph 
          "3(d)" above, with respect to the Restricted Shares held by the 
          designated escrow agent on behalf of the Participant, will lapse 
          upon the expiration of the Restriction Period.


4.   Death/Disability.  Notwithstanding Paragraph "3(e)" above to the 
contrary, if the Participant's employment is terminated pursuant to Section 
11(a) or 11(b) of the Employment Agreement at any time before the Restricted 
Period ends, the restrictions set forth in Paragraph "3(d)" above shall lapse 
as to that number of shares determined by multiplying 12,810 shares (subject 
to adjustment as provided in Section 18 of the Plan) by a fraction, the 
numerator of which shall be the number of months during the Restricted Period 
that the Participant was employed (including the month of termination) and the 
denominator of which shall be 60 months.  The Participant shall immediately 
forfeit all remaining Restricted Shares.

5.   Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination.  Notwithstanding 
Paragraph "3(e)" above to the contrary, if the Participant's employment is 
terminated pursuant to Section 11(d) of the Employment Agreement at any time 
before the Restriction Period ends, the restrictions set forth in Paragraph 
"3(d)" shall lapse as to that number of shares determined by multiplying 
12,810 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18 of the Plan) by 
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of months during the 
Restricted Period that the Participant was employed (including the month of 
termination) plus 18 months and the denominator of which shall be 60 months.  
The Participant shall immediately forfeit all remaining Restricted Shares.

6.   Noncompetition.  Section 20 of the Plan, entitled "Noncompetition 
Provision", shall not apply to the grant of the Restricted Shares.


7.   Withholding.  The Company, or the designated escrow agent at the request 
of the Company, shall be entitled to deduct from the Restricted Shares the 
amount of all applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld 
unless the Participant makes other arrangements with the Company for the 
timely payment of such taxes.

8.   Definitions.  Any defined term used in this Award Notice shall have the 
same meaning for purposes of this document as that ascribed to 
it under the terms of the Plan.
