                                   PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company or Kodak) is engaged primarily in 
developing, manufacturing and marketing consumer and commercial imaging 
products.  Kodak's sales, earnings and identifiable assets by industry 
segment for the past three years are shown in Segment Information on page 35.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSUMER IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the Consumer Imaging segment, including intersegment sales, for the 
past three years were:

(in millions)                               1996       1995       1994 

                                          $7,659     $6,830     $5,919

The products of the Consumer Imaging segment are used for capturing, 
recording or displaying a consumer originated image.  For example, 
traditional amateur photography requires, at a minimum, a camera, film and 
photofinishing.  Photofinishing requires equipment and supplies, including 
chemicals and paper for prints.

Kodak manufactures and markets various components of imaging systems.  For 
amateur photography, Kodak supplies films, photographic papers, processing 
services, photographic chemicals, cameras and projectors.  Recent imaging 
products developed by Kodak include new generations of films, cameras 
(including digital), photographic papers and one-time-use cameras.  In early 
1996, the Company announced its line-up of Advanced Photo System products 
encompassing new cameras, films and photofinishing.  The Advanced Photo 
System is a new amateur film format which delivers a variety of new consumer 
features such as drop-in loading, multiple print size options, index prints, 
and negatives returned in the cartridge.

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's consumer imaging products and services 
are distributed worldwide through a variety of channels.  Individual 
products are often used in substantial quantities in more than one market.  
Most sales of the Consumer Imaging segment are made through retailers.  
Independent retail outlets selling Kodak amateur products total many 
thousands.  In a few areas abroad, Kodak products are marketed by 
independent national distributors.

Kodak's advertising programs actively promote its products and services in 
its various markets, and its principal trademarks, trade dress and corporate 
symbol are widely used and recognized.

Kodak's consumer imaging products and services compete with similar products 
and services of others.  Competition in traditional imaging markets is 
strong throughout the world.  Many large and small companies offer similar 
products and services that compete with Kodak's business.  Kodak's products 
are continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its 
customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the Consumer Imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing.  Digital electronics 
are becoming more prevalent in product offerings.

<PAGE> 3

COMMERCIAL IMAGING SEGMENT

Sales of the Commercial Imaging segment for the past three years were:

(in millions)                                 1996       1995       1994

                                            $8,340     $8,184     $7,646

The Commercial Imaging segment consists of businesses that serve the imaging 
and information needs of commercial customers.  Products in this segment are 
used to capture, store, process and display images and information in a 
variety of forms.

Kodak products for the Commercial Imaging segment include films, 
photographic papers, photographic plates, chemicals, processing equipment 
and audiovisual equipment, as well as copiers, graphic arts films, microfilm 
products, applications software, printers and other business equipment, 
supplies and service agreements to support these products.  These products 
serve professional photofinishers, professional photographers, customers in 
the health care industry, and customers in motion picture, television, 
commercial printing and publishing, office automation, banking, insurance 
and government markets.  Recently introduced commercial imaging products 
include digital and applied imaging products which capture, store and print 
images in an electronic format.

On December 31, 1996, the Company and Danka Business Systems PLC (Danka) 
entered into an agreement for Danka to acquire the sales, marketing and 
equipment service operations of the Company's copier business as well as the 
Company's facilities management business known as Kodak Imaging Services.  
In connection with this agreement, the Company will supply high-volume 
copiers and printers to Danka.  

Marketing and Competition.  Kodak's commercial imaging products and services 
are distributed through a variety of channels.  The Company also sells and 
leases business equipment directly to users.  

Kodak's commercial imaging products and services compete with similar 
products and services of other small and large companies.  Strong 
competition exists throughout the world in these markets.  Kodak's products 
are continually improved to meet the changing needs and preferences of its 
customers.

Raw Materials.  The raw materials used by the Commercial Imaging segment are 
many and varied and generally available.  Silver is one of the essential 
materials in photographic film and paper manufacturing.  Electronic 
components represent a significant portion of the cost of the materials used 
in the manufacture of business equipment.
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - HEALTH BUSINESSES

In 1994, the Company divested the following non-imaging health businesses 
for aggregate gross proceeds of $7,858 million:  the pharmaceutical and 
consumer health businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products 
and do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical
Diagnostics Division.  The results of these businesses were reported as
discontinued operations in 1994.  Sales of products of these discontinued
health businesses for the year ended December 31, 1994 were $3,175 million. 

In 1996, the Company substantially completed negotiations with buyers and 
filed tax returns associated with the sale of the non-imaging health 
businesses.  As a result of these actions and a further assessment of the 
liabilities recorded at the time of the sale, the Company recognized a $277 
million after-tax benefit in discontinued operations in 1996.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Through the years, Kodak has engaged in extensive and productive efforts in 
research and development.  In 1996, $1,028 million (1995 - $935 million; 1994 - 
$859 million) was expended for research and development for continuing 
operations.  Research and development groups are located principally in the 
United States in Rochester, New York.  Outside the U.S., research and 
development groups are located principally in Australia, England, France, 
Japan and Germany.  These groups, in close cooperation with manufacturing 
units and marketing organizations, are constantly developing new products and 
applications to serve both existing and new markets.

It has been Kodak's general practice to protect its investment in research 
and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents 
where feasible.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's 
ability to use its inventions but at the same time is accompanied by patent 
licensing. While in the aggregate Kodak's patents are considered to be of 
material importance in the operation of its business, the Company does not 
consider that the patents relating to any single product or process are of 
material significance when judged from the standpoint of its total business.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning 
environmental matters.  Some of the U.S. federal environmental legislation 
having an impact on Kodak includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Air Act, and the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the 
Superfund law).

It is the policy of Eastman Kodak Company to carry out its business 
activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental 
management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and 
environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in a program 
for environmental protection and control.

Environmental protection is further discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, 
on page 5, and in the Notes to Financial Statements.  Refer to Note 1, 
Significant Accounting Policies, Environmental Costs, on page 19, and Note 
10, Commitments and Contingencies, on page 23.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMPLOYMENT

At the end of 1996, the Company employed 94,800 people, of whom 53,400 were 
employed in the U.S.  
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial information by geographic areas for the past three years is shown 
in Segment Information on page 34.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The Consumer Imaging segment of Kodak's business in the United States is 
centered in Rochester, New York, where photographic goods are manufactured.  
Another manufacturing facility near Windsor, Colorado, also produces 
sensitized photographic goods.  Regional distribution centers are located in 
various places within the United States.

Consumer imaging manufacturing facilities outside the United States are 
located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico and England.  Kodak 
maintains marketing and distribution facilities in many parts of the world.  
The Company also owns processing laboratories in numerous locations 
worldwide.

Products in the Commercial Imaging segment are manufactured primarily in 
Rochester, New York and Windsor, Colorado.  Manufacturing facilities outside 
the United States are located in Germany, Mexico, England and Ireland.

The Company owns or leases administrative, manufacturing, marketing and 
processing facilities in various parts of the world.  The leases are for 
various periods and are generally renewable.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In April 1987, the Company was sued in federal district court in San 
Francisco by a number of independent service organizations who alleged 
violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and of various state 
statutes in the sale by the Company of repair parts for its copier and 
micrographics equipment (Image Technical Service, Inc. (ITS), et al v. 
Eastman Kodak Company).  The complaint sought unspecified compensatory and 
punitive damages.  Trial began on June 19, 1995 and concluded on September 
18, 1995 with a jury verdict for plaintiffs of $23,948,300, before trebling.  
The Company's appeal of the jury's verdict was argued in the 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals on September 19, 1996, and a decision is awaited.  The 
Company intends to continue to vigorously defend the ITS case.

Three cases that raise essentially the same antitrust issues as ITS are 
pending (Nationwide, et al v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed March 10, 1995, 
A-1 Copy Center, et al v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed December 13, 1993, and 
Broward Microfilm, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Company, filed February 27, 1996).  
The Nationwide and A-1 cases are pending in federal district court in San 
Francisco, while Broward Microfilm is pending in federal district court in 
Miami.  A-1 is a consolidated class action, while Broward Microfilm purports 
to be a national class action.  The complaints in all three cases seek 
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  As is the case in ITS, the 
Company is defending these matters vigorously.

As a participant in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxic 
Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8 (e) Compliance Audit Program, the 
Company agreed to audit its files for materials which under current EPA 
guidelines would be subject to notification under Section 8 (e) of TSCA and 
to pay stipulated penalties for each report submitted under this program.  
The Company's participation in the Program  concluded in the fourth quarter, 
with the payment by the Company of a civil penalty of $750,000.

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
Act of 1980, as amended (the Superfund law), or under similar state laws, for 
environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the Company's 
alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at approximately 
twenty Superfund sites.  With respect to each of these sites, the Company's 
actual or potential allocated share of responsibility is small.  Furthermore, 
numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated at these sites and, 
although the law imposes joint and several liability on PRPs, as a practical 
matter, costs are shared with other PRPs.  Settlements and costs paid by the 
Company in Superfund matters to date have not been material.  Future costs 
are not expected to be material to the Company's financial position or 
results of operations.

1996

The Company results for the year included the following (all occurring in the 
fourth quarter):

    After-tax restructuring costs of $256 million.  Refer to Note 13 on page 
    28.

    An after-tax loss of $252 million related to the sale of the Office 
    Imaging business.  Refer to Note 2 on page 20.

    After-tax income of $277 million from discontinued operations associated 
    with the sale of the non-imaging health businesses in 1994.  Refer to 
    Note 3 on page 20.

Excluding these items, net earnings would have been $1,519 million and 
earnings per share would have been $4.50.

During the 1996 second quarter, Kodak concluded a $1 billion share repurchase 
program, announced in October 1995, and initiated an additional $2 billion 
repurchase program.

1995

Earnings included charges of $54 million ($51 million after-tax) for 
write-offs of intangible assets principally associated with the Health 
Imaging business.  

1994

In 1994, the Company divested the pharmaceutical and consumer health 
businesses of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and 
do-it-yourself products businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics 
Division for aggregate proceeds of $7.9 billion.  These businesses were 
reported as discontinued operations for 1994.  The Company used proceeds from 
the divestiture, short-term borrowings and cash from operations to extinguish 
$6,598 million (net carrying amount) of borrowings, $7,800 million (notional 
amount) of financial instruments, a $292 million master lease program and a 
$200 million receivable financing program.  

Earnings from continuing operations in 1994 included $340 million of pre-tax 
restructuring costs ($254 million or $.75 per share after-tax), pre-tax 
incremental charges associated with the review of the carrying value of 
assets of $65 million and a $110 million pre-tax loss associated with the 
extinguishment of certain financial instruments.  An extraordinary loss of 
$266 million after-tax ($.79 per share) was also recognized in connection with 
the reduction of debt and other financial instruments.  Earnings from 
discontinued operations were $269 million ($.80 per share), which was 
comprised of a net after-tax gain of $350 million realized from the sale of 
the non-imaging health businesses less an after-tax loss from operations 
prior to measurement date of $81 million.

1996 COMPARED WITH 1995

Worldwide sales in 1996 were 7% higher than in 1995, primarily due to higher 
unit volumes.  Currency changes against the dollar unfavorably affected sales 
by $243 million in 1996 compared with 1995.  

Consumer Imaging segment sales for the year were up 12%, primarily due to 
higher unit volumes partially offset by lower effective selling prices and 
unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate changes.  Sales increased both 
inside and outside the U.S.  Strong color film and paper volumes, 
photofinishing increases in Qualex and sales of Advantix products led the 
gains.  

Commercial Imaging segment sales for the year were up 2%, primarily due to 
higher unit volumes partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign 
currency rate changes and lower effective selling prices.  Sales increased 
outside the U.S., but were level in the U.S.  Declines in Office Imaging 
partially offset strong sales gains by Entertainment Imaging and continued 
growth in Business Imaging Systems and Digital and Applied Imaging.  

Earnings from operations decreased 5%; however, excluding restructuring costs 
of $358 million, earnings from operations increased 13%, as the benefits of 
higher unit volumes and manufacturing productivity were somewhat offset by 
lower effective selling prices and higher advertising expenditures.  

Earnings from operations in the Consumer Imaging segment decreased 9%; 
however, excluding restructuring costs of $183 million, earnings from 
operations increased 6%, as the benefits of higher unit volumes and 
manufacturing productivity were partially offset by lower effective selling 
prices and higher advertising expenditures. 

Earnings from operations in the Commercial Imaging segment increased 2%; 
however, excluding restructuring costs of $175 million, earnings from 
operations increased 28%, as the benefits of manufacturing productivity and 
higher unit volumes were somewhat offset by lower effective selling prices, 
higher research and development expenditures, and unfavorable effects of 
foreign currency rate changes. 

Research and development expenditures were $1,028 million in 1996 and $935 
million in 1995.  Goodwill charges were $66 million in 1996 and $109 million 
in 1995.  The 1995 figure includes write-offs of intangible assets of $54 
million, principally associated with the Health Imaging business.  
Advertising and sales promotion expenses totaled $1,026 million in 1996 and 
$840 million in 1995.  Other marketing and administrative expenses totaled 
$3,384 million in 1996 and $3,318 million in 1995.  

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues decreased 5%, primarily due 
to lower income from equity interests.  Excluding the $387 million pre-tax 
loss on the sale of the Office Imaging business from 1996, other costs 
decreased 54%, mostly due to lower foreign exchange losses.  

The effective tax rates were 34% in 1996, excluding restructuring costs and 
the sale of the Office Imaging business, and 35% in 1995.  The lower 
effective tax rate in 1996 principally results from the utilization of 
certain foreign tax loss carryforwards. 

1995 COMPARED WITH 1994

Worldwide 1995 sales from continuing operations increased 10% compared with 
1994, primarily due to higher unit volumes.  Excluding sales of the Company's 
Qualex subsidiary, acquired in August 1994, sales increased 8%, primarily due 
to higher unit volumes and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate 
changes.  Currency changes against the dollar favorably affected sales by 
$453 million in 1995 compared with 1994.

Sales for the Consumer Imaging segment increased significantly over 1994.  
Sales to customers in the U.S. increased substantially over 1994 due to 
higher volumes and the inclusion of Qualex revenues, whose sales are included 
in the consolidated totals from August 1994.  Prior to August 1994, Qualex's 
results were recorded using the equity method of accounting.  Sales to 
customers in the U.S., excluding Qualex's sales, increased slightly.  Sales 
to customers outside the U.S. increased significantly from 1994, as good 
volume gains and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes were 
only partially offset by lower effective selling prices.  Worldwide volume 
increases were led by color papers and films and one-time-use cameras.  

<PAGE>

Commercial Imaging sales showed a moderate sales increase over 1994.  Sales 
to customers in the U.S. increased 3%, as volume increases were slightly 
offset by lower effective selling prices.  Sales to customers outside the 
U.S. increased significantly from 1994, as good volume gains and the 
favorable effects of foreign currency rate changes were slightly offset by 
lower effective selling prices.  Entertainment Imaging and Digital and 
Applied Imaging led the worldwide sales increases.

Earnings from operations increased 48% from 1994.  Excluding 1994 
restructuring costs of $340 million, earnings from operations increased 18%.  

Consumer Imaging earnings from operations increased 43% (17% excluding 1994 
restructuring costs).  Earnings benefited from increased unit volumes, 
productivity gains and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate 
changes, but were adversely affected by cost escalation, higher levels of 
marketing and administrative activity and lower effective selling prices.

Commercial Imaging earnings from operations increased 59% (18% excluding 1994 
restructuring costs).  Earnings benefited from increased unit volumes, 
productivity gains and the favorable effects of foreign currency rate 
changes, but were adversely affected by cost escalation, lower effective 
selling prices, and $54 million of intangible asset write-offs principally 
associated with the Health Imaging business.

Research and development expenditures were $935 million in 1995 and $859 
million in 1994.  Goodwill charges were $109 million in 1995 and $67 million 
in 1994.  The increase was attributed to intangible asset write-offs, 
principally associated with the Health Imaging business, and the inclusion of 
a full year of Qualex goodwill amortization.  Advertising and sales promotion 
expenses totaled $840 million in 1995 and $744 million in 1994.  Other 
marketing and administrative expenses totaled $3,318 million in 1995 and 
$2,967 million in 1994.  Increases in selling, general and administrative 
expenses in 1995 resulted from the unfavorable effects of foreign currency 
rate changes, higher activity levels and the inclusion of a full year of 
Qualex activity.

Earnings from equity interests and other revenues were $289 million in 1995 
compared with $130 million in 1994.  The increase in 1995 was primarily due 
to higher interest income and gains from the sales of capital assets.  
Interest expense of $78 million in 1995 decreased from $142 million in 1994 
due to lower debt levels.  Other costs of $210 million in 1995 are 
essentially level with 1994 after excluding $110 million of 1994 pre-tax 
charges associated with the extinguishment of certain financial instruments.

The effective tax rates were 35% in 1995 and 39% in 1994, excluding 
restructuring costs.  The lower effective tax rate in 1995 principally 
results from the utilization of certain foreign tax loss carryforwards. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During the 1996 second quarter, Kodak concluded a $1 billion share repurchase 
program, announced in October 1995, and initiated an additional $2 billion 
repurchase program which is expected to extend over the next two to three 
years.  During 1996, $700 million of shares were purchased to complete the 
first program, and $623 million of shares have been purchased against the 
second program.

Cash flow from operations in 1996 was $2,484 million, primarily due to 
earnings from continuing operations of $1,011 million which included non-cash 
expenses for depreciation and amortization of $903 million.  Net cash outflow 
from investing activities was $636 million in 1996, due to capital 
expenditures of $1,341 million, offset by proceeds of $688 million from the 
sale of the Office Imaging business.  Net cash outflow from financing 
activities in 1996 of $1,833 million was primarily due to $1,323 million of 
stock repurchases and $539 million of dividend payments.

Total cash dividends (paid on a quarterly basis) of approximately $539 million 
($1.60 per share), $547 million ($1.60 per share) and $537 million ($1.60 per 
share) were declared in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  On January 15, 
1997, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.44 per share, 
representing an increase of $.04 per share, payable April 1 to shareholders 
of record, March 3, 1997.  

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year-end 1996 were $1,796 
million, a $15 million decrease from the year-end 1995 total of $1,811
million.  Net working capital at year-end 1996 decreased to $1,548 million
from $2,666 million at year-end 1995.  The net change was caused primarily by 
increases in short-term payables associated with the 1996 restructuring 
program and sale of the Office Imaging business, as well as decreases in 
accounts receivable due in part to the sale of the Office Imaging business.

Total short-term and long-term borrowings were $1,100 million at year-end 1996 
and $1,251 million at year-end 1995.  The Company has access to a $3.5 billion 
revolving credit facility expiring in November 2001.  The Company also has a 
shelf registration statement for debt securities with an available balance of 
$2.2 billion.

Capital additions were $599 million and $436 million for the Consumer Imaging 
segment in 1996 and 1995, respectively, and $742 million and $598 million for 
the Commercial Imaging segment. 

OTHER

The after-tax restructuring charge of $256 million resulted from a plan 
developed with the primary objective of dealing with infrastructure and 
operational inefficiencies and redundancies around the world, including 
actions required as a result of the sale of the Office Imaging business as 
well as rationalization of the Company's photofinishing operations outside 
the U.S.  The plan will result in the separation of approximately 3,900 
people, principally outside the U.S., and is expected to be largely completed 
in the next twelve months.  Approximately two-thirds of the charge relates to 
separation payments and one-third is for business exits and facility 
closures.

Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning 
environmental matters.  Refer to Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, on

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the 
consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear on pages 13 
through 36.  These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles and include certain amounts that are 
based on management's best estimates and judgments.
  The Company's accounting systems include extensive internal controls 
designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of its financial 
records and the proper safeguarding and use of its assets.  Such controls are 
based on established policies and procedures, are implemented by trained, 
skilled personnel with an appropriate segregation of duties, and are 
monitored through a comprehensive internal audit program.  The Company's 
policies and procedures prescribe that the Company and all employees are to 
maintain the highest ethical standards and that its business practices 
throughout the world are to be conducted in a manner which is above reproach.
  The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Price Waterhouse 
LLP, independent accountants, who were responsible for conducting their 
audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.  Their 
resulting report is shown below.
  The Board of Directors exercises its responsibility for these financial 
statements through its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of 
non-management Board members.  The independent accountants and internal 
auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee.  The Audit 
Committee meets periodically with the independent accountants and the 
Director of Corporate Auditing, both privately and with management present, 
to discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Eastman Kodak Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in 
the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 38 of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Eastman Kodak Company and subsidiary companies at December 31, 
1996 and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements 
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We 
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed 
above.

Eastman Kodak Company and Subsidiary Companies
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

COMPANY OPERATIONS

Eastman Kodak Company (the Company or Kodak) is engaged primarily in 
developing, manufacturing, and marketing consumer and commercial imaging 
products.  The Company's products are manufactured in a number of countries 
in North and South America, Europe, Australia and Asia.  The Company's 
products are marketed and sold in many countries throughout the world.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastman Kodak 
Company and its majority owned subsidiary companies.  Intercompany 
transactions are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of 
the earnings of subsidiaries applicable to minority interests.  

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Certain significant 
estimates are disclosed throughout this report.

FOREIGN CURRENCY 

For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is 
the functional currency and translation adjustments are accumulated in a 
separate component of shareholders' equity.

For subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic 
environment is highly inflationary, the U.S. dollar is the functional 
currency and gains and losses that result from translation are included in 
earnings.  The effect from foreign currency translation was a loss of $4 
million in 1996, a gain of $14 million in 1995 and a loss of $7 million in 
1994. 

The Company hedges certain foreign currency transactions and firm foreign 
currency commitments by entering into forward exchange contracts.  Gains and 
losses associated with currency rate changes on forward contracts hedging 
foreign currency transactions are recorded currently in earnings.  The 
effects from foreign currency transactions, including related hedging 
activities, were losses of $37 million in 1996, $76 million in 1995 and $46 
million in 1994.  Gains and losses related to hedges of firm commitments are 
deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments of carrying amounts 
when the transaction occurs.   
       
CASH EQUIVALENTS

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or 
less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND NONCURRENT INVESTMENTS

Investments included in marketable securities of $18 million and $42 million 
and in long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets of $46 million and 
$60 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, are considered held 
to maturity.  Investments included in marketable securities of $1 million and 
$5 million and in long-term receivables and other noncurrent assets of $59 
million and $55 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, are 
considered available for sale.  The maturities of long-term receivables range 
from 1998 to 2004.

Proceeds from the sale of securities were $59 million in 1996 and $48 million 
in 1995.  No gain or loss was realized from the sale of these securities in 
1996 or 1995.  Specific identification was used to determine the cost of 
securities sold.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at cost, which is not in excess of market.  The cost 
of most inventories in the U.S. is determined by the "last-in, first-out" 
(LIFO) method.  The cost of other inventories is determined by the "first-in, 
first-out" (FIFO) or average cost method.

<PAGE>

PROPERTIES

Properties are recorded at cost reduced by accumulated depreciation.  
Depreciation expense is provided based on historical cost and estimated 
useful lives ranging from approximately 5 years to 50 years for buildings and 
building equipment and 3 years to 20 years for machinery and equipment.  The 
Company generally uses the straight-line method for calculating the provision 
for depreciation.  The Company regularly assesses all of its long-lived 
assets for impairment, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of."  The impact of adopting SFAS 
No. 121 in 1996 was not material to the Company's financial position or 
results of operations.  

GOODWILL

Goodwill is charged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the period 
estimated to be benefited, not exceeding fifteen years for continuing 
operations.  The carrying value of goodwill is assessed periodically based on 
the expected future cash flows of the asset grouping associated with the 
goodwill.  

REVENUE

Revenue is recognized from the sale of film, paper, supplies and equipment 
(including sales-type leases for equipment) when the product is shipped; from 
maintenance and service contracts over the contractual period, or as the 
services are performed; from rentals under operating leases in the month in 
which they are earned; and from financing transactions at level rates of 
return over the term of the lease or receivable.

ADVERTISING

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in "selling, general 
and administrative expenses."  Advertising expenses amounted to 
$1,026 million, $840 million and $744 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, 
respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or 
capitalized, as appropriate.  Remediation costs that relate to an existing 
condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that 
these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes.  
Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the 
amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes 
and such amounts recognized for tax purposes.  

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share, where such calculation is not anti-dilutive, is computed 
on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain reclassifications of 1995 and 1994 financial statement and related 
footnote amounts have been made to conform with the 1996 presentation.

NOTE 2

SALE OF ASSETS

On December 31, 1996, Danka Business Systems PLC (Danka) and Kodak entered 
into an agreement for Danka to acquire the sales, marketing and equipment 
service operations of Kodak's Office Imaging business, as well as Kodak's 
facilities management business known as Kodak Imaging Services.  In 
connection with this agreement, Kodak will supply high-volume copiers and 
printers to Danka.  Danka paid Kodak $688 million in cash in exchange for 
certain assets and the assumption of certain operating liabilities.  The book 
value of net assets sold was $802 million.  The Company recorded amounts for 
employee separation payments, contract termination payments, transaction 
costs and other significant items.  As a result of this transaction, the 
Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $387 million in other costs.  The 
after-tax loss was $252 million. 

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 3

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In 1994, the Company sold the pharmaceutical and consumer health businesses 
of Sterling Winthrop Inc., the household products and do-it-yourself products 
businesses of L&F Products and the Clinical Diagnostics Division.  The Company 
received $7,858 million in proceeds from the sale of these businesses.  The 
results of these businesses were reported as discontinued operations in 1994.  
Summarized results of these businesses, including allocations of interest 
expense, in 1994 included sales of $3,175 million, a loss from the 
measurement date to the disposal date of $77 million ($86 million pre-tax), a 
gain on the sale of businesses of $1,933 million before income taxes of 
$1,506 million and an after-tax loss prior to measurement date of $81 million 
($84 million pre-tax). 

In computing the net gain from discontinued operations, the Company recorded 
amounts for environmental exposures, product liabilities, buyer 
indemnifications, purchase price adjustments, taxes and other significant 
items based on the best estimates available at the time the transactions 
occurred.  The Company has substantially completed negotiations with buyers 
and filed tax returns associated with the sale of the non-imaging health 
businesses.  As a result of these actions and a further assessment of the 
liabilities recorded at the time of the sale, the Company recognized a $277 
million after-tax benefit in discontinued operations in 1996, the primary 
component of which is income and other taxes.  While the remaining balances 
included in these reserves are believed to be appropriate based on 
management's current judgments, changes could occur as audits and other 
activities related to these transactions are completed.

The Company sells to customers in a variety of industries, markets and 
geographies around the world.  Receivables arising from these sales are 
generally not collateralized.  Adequate provisions have been recorded for 
uncollectible receivables.  There are no significant concentrations of credit 
risk.

Short-term bank borrowings, primarily by subsidiaries outside the U.S., 
totaled $296 million at year-end 1996 and $586 million at year-end 1995.  The 
weighted average interest rate was 7.0% in 1996 and 4.7% in 1995. 

The Company has a $3,500 million unused revolving credit facility established 
in 1996 and expiring in November 2001 which is available to support the 
Company's commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.  If 
unused, it has a commitment fee of $1.9 million per year.  Interest on amounts 
borrowed under this facility is calculated at rates based on spreads above 
certain reference rates.  The Company also has a shelf registration statement 
for debt securities with an available balance of $2,200 million.

NOTE 10

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Expenditures for pollution prevention and waste treatment for continuing 
operations at various manufacturing facilities were as follows:

                                    1996     1995     1994
(in millions) 

Recurring costs for managing
 hazardous substances and 
 pollution                          $ 76     $ 72     $ 83
Capital expenditures to limit
 or monitor hazardous substances
 and pollutants                       37       31       36

Site remediation costs                 3        3        3
                                    ----     ----     ----

     Total                          $116     $106     $122
                                    ====     ====     ====  

At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Company's accrued liabilities for 
environmental remediation costs amounted to $106 million and $114 million, 
respectively.

The Company expects these recurring and remediation costs and capital 
expenditures to increase in the future.  It is not expected that these costs 
will have an impact materially different from 1996's environmental 
expenditures on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash 
flows or competitive position. 

In October 1994, the Company, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
the U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement of a civil complaint 
alleging noncompliance by the Company with federal environmental regulations 
at the Company's Kodak Park manufacturing site in Rochester, New York.  The 
Company paid a penalty of $5 million.  A Consent Decree was signed under 
which the Company is subject to a Compliance Schedule by which the Company 
will improve its waste characterization procedures, upgrade one of its 
incinerators, and evaluate and upgrade its industrial sewer system.  The 
total expenditures required to complete this program are currently estimated 
to be approximately $70 million over the next seven years.  These 
expenditures are capital in nature.  

The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP) 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
Act of 1980, as amended (the Superfund law), or under similar state laws, for 
environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the Company's 
alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at approximately 
twenty Superfund sites.  With respect to each of these sites, the Company's 
actual or potential allocated share of responsibility is small.  Furthermore, 
numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated at these sites and, 
although the law imposes joint and several liability on PRPs, as a practical 
matter, costs are shared with other PRPs.  Settlements and costs paid by the 
Company in Superfund matters to date have not been material.  Future costs 
are also not expected to be material to the Company's financial position or 
results of operations.

In addition to the foregoing environmental actions, the Resource Conservation 
and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Assessment (RFA) pertaining to the Kodak 
Park site in Rochester, N.Y. is nearly complete and the Company has completed 
a broad-based assessment of the site in response to the RFA.  While future 
expenditures associated with any remediation activities could be significant, 
the Company is currently in the process of completing the RCRA Facility 
Investigation (RFI).  Upon completion of the RFI, the Company expects to have 
developed estimates of the required remediation costs.

The Clean Air Act Amendments were enacted in 1990.  Expenditures to comply 
with the Clean Air Act implementing regulations issued to date have not been 
material and have been primarily capital in nature.  Future capital 
expenditures cannot be reasonably estimated at the present time, as certain 
of the regulations of this Act have not been issued.

The Company has retained certain obligations for environmental remediation 
matters related to the non-imaging health businesses sold in 1994.  Actions 
to fulfill these obligations are not expected to be completed in the near 
term and costs related to the obligations are included in remediation 
accruals recorded at December 31, 1996.

The Company has entered into agreements with several companies to provide the 
Company with products and services to be used in its normal operations.  The 
minimum payments for these agreements are approximately $94 million in 1997, 
$88 million in 1998, $79 million in 1999, $62 million in 2000, $12 million in 
2001 and $12 million in 2002 and thereafter.

The Company has also guaranteed debt and other obligations under agreements 
with certain affiliated companies and customers.  At December 31, 1996, these 
guarantees totaled approximately $143 million.  The Company does not expect 
that these guarantees will have a material impact on the Company's future 
financial position or results of operations.

The Company has issued letters of credit in lieu of making security deposits 
to insure the payment of possible Workers' Compensation claims.

Rental expense, net of minor sublease income, amounted to $242 million in 
1996 and $189 million in both 1995 and 1994.  The approximate amounts of 
noncancelable lease commitments with terms of more than one year, principally 
for the rental of real property, reduced by minor sublease income, are 
$188 million in 1997, $153 million in 1998, $120 million in 1999, $92 million
in 2000, $76 million in 2001 and $103 million in 2002 and thereafter.

The Company and its subsidiary companies are involved in lawsuits, claims, 
investigations and proceedings, including product liability, commercial, 
environmental, and health and safety matters, which are being handled and 
defended in the ordinary course of business.  There are no such matters 
pending that the Company and its General Counsel expect to be material in 
relation to the Company's business, financial position or results of 
operations.

The fair values of long-term borrowings were determined by reference to 
quoted market prices or by obtaining quotes from dealers.  Marketable 
securities and other investments are valued at quoted market prices, except 
for $31 million and $34 million of equity investments included in other 
investments at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, which are reflected 
at their carrying value because it is not practical to estimate fair value as 
quoted market prices do not exist.  The fair values for the remaining 
financial instruments in the above table are based on dealer quotes and 
reflect the estimated amounts the Company would pay or receive to terminate 
the contracts.  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, 
receivables, short-term borrowings and payables approximate their fair 
values.

The Company, as a result of its global operating and financial activities, is 
exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position.  
In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such 
activities, the Company manages exposure to changes in interest rates and 
foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing 
activities.  In certain instances, the Company manages exposures to foreign 
currency exchange rate changes through foreign currency forward agreements 
with third parties.  The Company does not utilize financial instruments for 
trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged 
financial instruments.  

The table below summarizes by major currency the notional amounts of foreign 
currency forward contracts in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currency amounts are 
translated at rates current at the reporting date.  The "buy" amounts 
represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign 
currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of 
commitments to sell foreign currencies.  Substantially all of the Company's 
foreign currency forward agreements will mature during 1997.

The Company's financial instrument counterparties are high quality investment 
or commercial banks with significant experience with such instruments.  The 
Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum 
credit standards and diversification of counterparties.  The Company has 
procedures to monitor the credit exposure amounts.

The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to certain net operating 
loss carryforwards outside the U.S.  A majority of the net operating loss 
carryforwards are subject to a five-year expiration period.

Retained earnings of subsidiary companies outside the U.S. were approximately 
$1,466 million and $1,924 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 
Retained earnings at December 31, 1996 are considered to be reinvested 
indefinitely.  If remitted, they would be substantially free of additional 
tax.  It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability for 
temporary differences related to these retained earnings.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS

1996 Restructuring Program

In December 1996, the Company committed to implement a restructuring program 
and recorded a pre-tax provision of $358 million ($256 million after-tax).  
In addition, $20 million of reserves from the 1993 restructuring program will 
be utilized for actions associated with the 1996 program.  The principal 
purpose of the program is to eliminate infrastructure and operational 
inefficiencies and redundancies throughout the Company by taking actions to 
separate personnel, close facilities and exit from non-strategic businesses.  
A portion of the program includes the restructuring of retail and wholesale 
photofinishing operations, primarily outside the U.S.  Additionally, the plan 
addressed certain infrastructure activities which supported the Office 
Imaging business, which was sold to Danka Business Systems PLC.  

This program will result in the separation of 3,900 employees worldwide at a 
cost of $260 million.  Approximately 1,200 of the separations are expected to 
occur in the U.S. and 2,700 outside the U.S.  Separations by functional area 
are as follows: 2,400 administrative and marketing, 1,300 services including 
photofinishing and 200 manufacturing.  Most of the separations are expected 
to be completed by the end of 1997.  Approximately $118 million of the 
restructuring costs relate to business exits and facility closures.  No 
significant amounts have been utilized in 1996.


1994 Restructuring Program

The Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring provision of $340 million in 1994 
for severance and other termination benefits and exit costs related to the 
realignment of the Company's worldwide manufacturing, marketing, 
administrative and photofinishing operations.  In addition, $50 million of 
reserves from the 1993 restructuring program were utilized for these actions.  
At December 31, 1996, substantially all of the personnel had been terminated 
with approximately $60 million, $260 million, and $30 million being paid in 
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  These amounts were spent substantially 
according to plan.  The remaining accrual balance at December 31, 1996, in 
the amount of $40 million, will primarily provide for severance, 
non-cancelable lease payments and business exit costs.

NOTE 14

RETIREMENT PLANS

Substantially all U.S. employees are covered by a noncontributory plan, the 
Kodak Retirement Income Plan (KRIP), which is funded by Company contributions 
to an irrevocable trust fund.  Assets in the fund are held for the sole 
benefit of retired employees.  The assets of the trust fund are comprised of 
corporate equity and debt securities, U.S. government securities, partnership 
and joint venture investments, interests in pooled funds, and various types 
of interest rate and foreign currency financial instruments.

Retirement benefits earned by employees prior to January 1, 1996, are based 
on a point system.  Retirement benefits earned by employees subsequent to 
December 31, 1995, are based on age and years of service.   The benefit 
formula used to calculate the actual benefit dollars paid to an individual 
once retired has not changed as a result of these new plan provisions.

The benefit obligations for KRIP include amounts for employees who retired 
from Eastman Chemical Company (ECC) on or before December 31, 1993, the date 
ECC was spun off from the Company.  Benefit obligations of all other ECC 
employees were transferred to ECC as part of the spin-off agreement.  The 
benefit obligation of KRIP excludes amounts for all employees (both retired 
and active) of the non-imaging health businesses sold in 1994 because those 
obligations were transferred to the buyers of the non-imaging health 
businesses.  The market value of assets of KRIP reflect the Company's 
estimates of assets held for employees in continuing operations only.  The 
transfer of assets from the KRIP trust fund to ECC and the buyers of the 
non-imaging health businesses was not completed as of December 31, 1996.  The 
Company anticipates the transfer of assets to ECC to be completed in 1997, 
with the non-imaging health businesses to follow.  The Company retained the 
obligation for employees of the Office Imaging sales, marketing and equipment 
service functions and recorded a $12 million curtailment loss in 1996 as a 
result of the sale of this business.

Most subsidiaries and branches operating outside the U.S. have retirement 
plans covering substantially all employees.  Contributions by the Company for 
these plans are typically deposited under government or other fiduciary-type 
arrangements.  Retirement benefits are generally based on contractual 
agreements that provide for benefit formulas using years of service and/or 
compensation prior to retirement.  The actuarial assumptions used for these 
plans reflect the diverse economic environments within the various countries 
in which the Company operates.

</TABLE>

The annual cost of postretirement employee benefits is based on assumed 
discount rates.  These rates are set relative to the general level of 
interest rates in the economy.  As a result, significant year-to-year changes 
in interest rates can cause material year-to-year changes in assumed discount 
rates and employee benefit liabilities and costs based on those rates.   

The Company also sponsors an unfunded plan for certain U.S. employees 
(primarily executives).  The benefits of this plan are obtained by applying 
KRIP provisions to all compensation, including compensation currently being 
deferred, and without regard to the legislated qualified plan maximums, 
reduced by benefits under KRIP.  At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the projected 
benefit obligations of this plan amounted to $197 million and $159 million, 
respectively.  The Company had recorded long-term liabilities at those dates 
of $179 million and $143 million, respectively.  Pension expense recorded in 
1996, 1995 and 1994 related to this plan was $24 million, $17 million and $17 
million, respectively.

NOTE 15

NONPENSION POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company provides health care, dental and life insurance benefits to 
eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees.  In general, these 
benefits are provided to U.S. retirees that are covered by the provisions of 
the Company's principal pension plan.  A few of the Company's subsidiaries 
and branches operating outside the U.S. offer health care benefits; however, 
the cost of such benefits is insignificant to the Company.

Net nonpension postretirement benefit cost includes the following:

The total obligation and amount recognized in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position at December 31, 1996 and 1995, were as follows:

To estimate this obligation, health care costs were assumed to increase 8% in 
1997 with the rate of increase declining to an ultimate trend of 5% in 2002.  
If the health care cost trend rates were increased by one percentage point, 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, as of December 31, 1996, 
would increase by approximately $90 million while the net postretirement 
benefit cost for the year then ended would increase by approximately $9 
million.  The discount rates utilized to measure the obligation at December 
31, 1996 and 1995, were 7.5% and 7.25%, respectively.  The annual costs of 
employee benefits related to postretirement are based on assumed discount 
rates set relative to the general level of interest rates in the economy.  As 
a result, significant year-to-year changes in interest rates can cause 
material year-to-year changes in assumed discount rates and employee benefit 
liabilities and costs based on these rates.  The Company recorded a $97 
million curtailment gain in 1996 as a result of the sale of the Office 
Imaging business, which is included in the loss on the sale.

NOTE 16

STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company's stock incentive plans consist of the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term 
Compensation Plan (the 1995 Plan), the 1990 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation 
Plan (the 1990 Plan) and the 1985 Stock Option Plan (the 1985 Plan).  The 
Plans are administered by the Executive Compensation and Development 
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Under the 1995 Plan, 16 million shares of the Company's common stock may be 
granted to a variety of employees between February 1, 1995 and December 31, 
1999.  Option prices are not less than 100 percent of the per share fair 
market value on the date of grant, and the options generally expire 10 years 
from the dates of grant, but may expire sooner if the optionee's employment 
terminates.  The 1995 Plan also provides for Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) 
to be granted, either in tandem with options or freestanding.  SARs allow 
optionees to receive payment equal to the difference between the Company's 
stock market price on grant date and exercise date.  At December 31, 1996, 
346,650 freestanding SARs were outstanding at option prices ranging from 
$56.31 to $83.19.

Under the 1990 Plan, 16 million shares of the Company's common stock could be 
granted to key employees between February 1, 1990 and January 31, 1995.  
Option prices could not be less than 50 percent of the per share fair market 
value on the date of grant; however, no options below fair market value were 
granted. The options generally expire 10 years from the dates of grant, but 
may expire sooner if the optionee's employment terminates.  The 1990 Plan 
also provided that options with dividend equivalents, tandem SARs and 
freestanding SARs could be granted.  At December 31, 1996, 113,702 tandem 
SARs and 260,931 freestanding SARs were outstanding at option prices ranging 
from $31.45 to $44.50.

Under the 1985 Plan, approximately 1.7 million options, 181,860 tandem SARs 
and 34,900 freestanding SARs were outstanding at December 31, 1996, at option 
prices ranging from $33.79 to $39.53.  The 1985 Plan terms are similar to the 
1995 Plan terms.

Further information relating to options is as follows:

Outstanding on December 31, 1995            21,198,746        $30.25 - $69.50
Granted                                      3,359,338        $68.00 - $83.44
Exercised                                    3,410,660        $30.25 - $71.81
Terminated, Canceled or Surrendered            292,986        $31.45 - $75.69
Outstanding on December 31, 1996            20,854,438        $30.25 - $83.44
Exercisable on December 31, 1996            15,103,173        $30.25 - $69.50


The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting 
for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB No. 25), in accounting for employee stock 
options.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for stock 
option plans.

Pro forma net earnings and earnings per share information, as required by 
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," has been determined 
as if the Company had accounted for employee stock options under SFAS No. 
123's fair value method.  The fair value of these options was estimated at 
grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following 
weighted-average assumptions for 1996 and 1995, respectively: dividend yields 
of 2.25% and 3%; volatility factors of the expected market price of the 
Company's common stock of 25%; an expected option life of 7 years; and the 7 
year U.S. treasury interest rate on the grant dates.  For purposes of pro 
forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to 
expense over the options' vesting period (3 years).  The Company's pro forma 
information follows: 

(in millions, except per share data)              1996            1995

Pro Forma Net Earnings                          $1,262          $1,242

Pro Forma Earnings Per Share                    $ 3.74          $ 3.64

This disclosure is not likely to be representative of the effects on reported 
net earnings for future years, because options vest over three years and 
additional awards generally are made each year.  

The weighted-average fair value of options granted was $22.84 and $17.43 for 
1996 and 1995, respectively.

The Company recognized compensation expense of $31 million, $70 million and 
$10 million related to stock-based employee compensation awards in 1996, 1995 
and 1994,  respectively.

Article 4.     Deferral of Compensation

For any given calendar year, a Participant may make a deferral election, in 
accordance with the requirements of Article 5 below, to defer receipt of all 
or any portion of his or her Deferrable Amount to be earned during such year 
into his or her Accounts.  Any Deferrable Amount which is so deferred shall 
be credited to the Participant's Accounts in accordance with Article 6 below.


Article 5.     Deferral Elections

5.1  In General

A Participant may make a deferral election to defer compensation by executing 
and returning to the Administrator in accordance with this Article 5 a 
deferred compensation form provided by Kodak.

5.2  Timing

A Participant who wishes to make a deferral election must irrevocably elect 
to do during an Enrollment Period.  Such election shall be effective for the 
calendar year immediately following the Enrollment Period during which such 
election was made and for all succeeding calendar years, unless the 
Participant revokes his or her election or files a new election during the 
Enrollment Period for such a succeeding calendar year.  In which case, such 
revocation or election, as the case may be, shall be effective on the 
first day of such succeeding calendar year.

5.3  Irrevocability

Deferral elections made under this Plan with respect to any calendar year 
will be final and, after the close of the Enrollment Period for such calendar 
year, may not be revoked or amended in any manner until the Enrollment Period 
for a succeeding calendar.  In which case, such revocation or amendment, as 
the case may be, shall be effective on the first day of such succeeding 
calendar year.

5.4  Elections

A deferred compensation form filed by a Participant during an Enrollment 
Period shall indicate: (1) the amount of the Deferrable Amount to be 
deferred; and (2) the allocation in whole percentages of the deferred 
Deferrable Amount between the Deferred Compensation Account and the Stock 
Account.

Amounts in a Participant's Deferred Compensation Account are hypothetically 
invested in an interest bearing account which bears interest computed at the 
Interest Rate, compounded monthly.

6.2  Stock Account

Amounts in a Participant's Stock Account are hypothetically invested in units 
of Common Stock.  Amounts transferred to a Stock Account are recorded as 
units of Common Stock, and fractions thereof, with one unit equating to a 
single share of Common Stock.  Thus, the value of one unit shall be the 
Market Value of a single share of Common Stock.  The use of units is merely a 
bookkeeping convenience; the units are not actual shares of Common Stock.  
Kodak will not reserve or otherwise set aside any Common Stock for or to any 
Stock Account.

6.3  Time Accounts are Credited

Amounts to be deferred shall be credited to the Participant's Accounts on the 
date such amounts would otherwise be payable.

6.4  Stock Account Crediting

     A.   If a Participant makes an election to defer into his or her Stock 
          Account pursuant to Section 5.4 above, the Stock Account of the 
          Participant shall, for so long as the election remains in effect, 
          be credited with that number of units of Common Stock, and 
          fractions thereof, determined in accordance with Section 6.4(B) 
          immediately below as of each applicable date specified in Section 
          6.3 above.

     B.   In accordance with Section 6.4(A) above, the Stock Account of a 
          Participant shall be credited with that number of units of Common 
          Stock, and fractions thereof, equal to the number of full and 
          fractional shares of Common Stock, that could be purchased with the 
          dollar amount that would otherwise be paid to the Participant but 
          for his or her election to defer into the Stock Account using the 
          Market Value of the Common Stock as of the applicable date 
          specified in Section 6.3 above.


Article 7.     Investment Elections

7.1  Elections

A Participant may make an investment election to direct that all or any 
portion, designated as a whole percentage, of the existing balance of one of 
his or her Accounts be transferred to his or her other Account, effective as 
of the close of business on the last day of any calendar month (hereinafter 
the election's "Effective Date"), by filing a written election with the 
Administrator on or prior to such date.

7.2  Election into the Stock Account

If a Participant makes an investment election pursuant to Section 7.1 to 
transfer an amount from his or her Deferred Compensation Account to his or 
her Stock Account, effective as of the election's Effective Date, (i) his or 
her  Stock Account shall be credited with that number of units of Common 
Stock, and fractions thereof, obtained by dividing the dollar amount elected 
to be transferred by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the Valuation 
Date immediately preceding or coincident with the election's Effective Date; 
and (ii) his or her Deferred Compensation Account shall be reduced by the 
amount elected to be transferred.

7.3  Election out of the Stock Account

If a Participant makes an investment election pursuant to Section 7.1 to 
transfer an amount from his or her Stock Account to his or her Deferred 
Compensation Account, effective as of the election's Effective Date, (i) his 
or her Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited with a dollar amount 
equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the number of units to be 
transferred by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the Valuation Date 
immediately preceding or coincident with the election's Effective Date; and 
(ii) his or her Stock Account shall be reduced by the number of units elected 
to be transferred.

7.4  Dividend Equivalents

Effective as of the payment date for each cash dividend on the Common Stock, 
additional units of Common Stock shall be credited to the Stock Account of 
each Participant who has a balance in his or her Stock Account on the record 
date for such dividend.  The number of units that shall be credited 
to the Stock Account of such a Participant shall be computed by multiplying 
the dollar value of the dividend paid upon a single share of Common Stock by 
the number of units of Common Stock held in the Participant's Stock Account 
on the record date for such dividend and dividing the product thereof by the 
Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date for such dividend.

7.5  Stock Dividends

Effective as of the payment date for each stock dividend (as defined in 
Section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) on the Common Stock, 
additional units of Common Stock shall be credited to the Stock Account of 
each Participant who has a balance in his or her Stock Account on the record 
date for such dividend.  The number of units that shall be credited to the 
Stock Account of such a Participant shall equal the number of shares of 
Common Stock which the Participant would have received as stock dividends had 
he or she been the owner on the record date for such stock dividend of the 
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of units credited to his 
or her Stock Account on such record date.  To the extent the Participant 
would have also received cash, in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock, 
had he or she been the record owner of such shares for such stock dividend, 
then his or her Stock Account shall also be credited with that number of 
units, or fractions thereof, equal to such cash amount divided by the Market 
Value of the Common Stock on the payment date for such dividend.

7.6  Recapitalization

If Kodak undergoes a reorganization as defined in Section 368 (a) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Administrator may, in his or her sole and 
absolute discretion, take whatever action he or she deems necessary, 
advisable or appropriate with respect to the Stock Accounts in order to 
reflect such transaction, including, but not limited to, adjusting the number 
of units credited to a Participant's Stock Account.

7.7  Distributions

Amounts in respect of units of Common Stock shall be distributed in cash in 
accordance with Articles 8 and 11.  For purposes of a distribution pursuant 
to Articles 8 or 11, the number of units to be distributed from a 
Participant's Stock Account shall be valued by multiplying the number of such 
units by the Market Value of the Common Stock as of the Valuation Date 
immediately preceding the date such distribution is to occur.  Pending the 
complete distribution under Section 8.2 of the Stock Account of a Participant 
who is no longer a member of the Board, the Participant shall continue to be 
able to make elections pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.3 and his or her Stock 
Account shall continue to be credited with additional units of Common Stock 
pursuant to Sections 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6.


Article 8.     Payment of Deferred Compensation

8.1  Background

No withdrawal may be made from a Participant's Accounts except as provided in 
this Article 8 and Article 11.

8.2  Manner of Payment

Payment of a Participant's Accounts shall be made at the sole discretion of 
the Administrator in a single sum or in annual installments; provided, 
however, that payment in the event of death shall be made in accordance with 
Section 8.5 below.  The maximum number of annual installments is ten.  All 
payments from the Plan shall be made in cash.

<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 52

8.3  Timing of Payments

Payments shall be made as soon as administratively possible following the 
fifth business day in March and shall commence in any year designated by the 
Administrator up through the tenth year following the year in which the 
Participant for any reason ceases to be a member of the Board.  
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, payment in the event of 
death shall be made in accordance with Section 8.5.

8.4  Valuation

The amount of each payment shall be equal to the value, as of the immediately 
preceding Valuation Date, of the Participant's Accounts, divided by the 
number of installments remaining to be paid.  If payment of a Participant's 
Accounts is determined by the Administrator to be paid in installments and 
the Participant has a balance in his or her Stock Account at the time of the 
payment of an installment, the amount that shall be distributed from his or 
her Stock Account shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the total 
amount of the installment determined in accordance with the immediately 
preceding sentence by the percentage obtained by dividing the balance in the 
Stock Account as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date by the total 
value of the Participant's Accounts as of such Valuation Date.  Similarly, in 
such case, the amount that shall be distributed from the Participant's 
Deferred Compensation Account shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the 
total amount of the installment determined in accordance with the first 
sentence of this Section 8.4 by the percentage obtained by dividing the 
balance in the Deferred Compensation Account as of the immediately preceding 
Valuation Date by the total value of the Participant's Accounts as of such 
Valuation Date.

8.5  Payment of Deferred Compensation After Death

If a Participant dies prior to complete payment of his or her Accounts, the 
provisions of this Section 8.5 shall become operative.

     A.   Stock Account.  Effective as of the date of a Participant's death,    
     the entire balance of his or her Stock Account shall be transferred to 
     his or her Deferred Compensation Account.  For purposes of valuing the 
     units of Common Stock subject to such a transfer, the deceased 
     Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited with a 
     dollar amount equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the number of 
     units in the deceased Participant's Stock Account at the time of his or 
     her death by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of his or 
     her death.  Thereafter, no amounts in the deceased Participant's 
     Deferred Compensation Account shall be eligible for transfer to the 
     deceased Participant's Stock Account by any person, including, but not 
     by way of limitation, the deceased Participant's beneficiary or legal 
     representative.

     B.   Distribution.  The balance of the Participant's Accounts, valued as 
          of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date payment is 
          made, shall be paid in a single, lump-sum payment to: (1) the 
          beneficiary or contingent beneficiary designated by the Participant 
          in accordance with Section 8.5(C); or, in the absence of a valid 
          designation of a beneficiary or contingent beneficiary, (2) the 
          Participant's estate within 30 days after appointment of a legal 
          representative of the deceased Participant.

     C.   Beneficiary Designation.  Each Participant shall have the right, at 
          any time, to designate any person or persons as his or her 
          Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (both primary and contingent) to whom 
          payment under this Plan shall be paid in the event of his or her 
          death prior to complete distribution to the Participant of the 
          benefits due him or her under the Plan.  Each Beneficiary 
          designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with 
          the Administrator during the Participant's lifetime on a form 
          provided by the Administrator.  The filing of a new Beneficiary 
          designation form with the Administrator will cancel all Beneficiary 
          designation(s) previously filed.

Preamble.

The 1982 Eastman Kodak Company Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is an 
unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation arrangement for eligible 
executives of Eastman Kodak Company and certain of its subsidiaries effective 
for compensation earned in 1982 and later years.  Under the Plan, each 
Eligible Employee is annually given an opportunity to elect to defer payment 
of part of his or her compensation earned during the year following his or 
her election.


Article 1.     Definitions

1.1  Account

"Account" means the Deferred Compensation Account or the Stock Account.

1.2  Board

"Board" means Board of Directors of Kodak.

1.3  Change In Control

"Change in Control" means a change in control of Kodak of a nature that would 
be required to be reported (assuming such event has not been "previously 
reported") in response to Item 1(a) of the Current Report of Form 8-K, as in 
effect on August 1, 1989, pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); provided that, without 
limitation, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred at such time 
as (i) any "person" within the meaning of Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act 
is or has become the "beneficial owner" as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 
Exchange Act, directly or indirectly, of 25% or more of the combined voting 
power of the outstanding securities of Kodak ordinarily having the right to 
vote at the election of directors ("Voting Securities"), or (ii) individuals 
who constitute the Board of Directors of Kodak on August 1, 1989 (the 
"Incumbent Board") have ceased for any reason to constitute at least a 
majority thereof, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to 
August 1, 1989 whose election, or nomination for election by Kodak's 
stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least three-quarters (3/4) of the 
directors comprising the Incumbent Board (either by a specific vote or by 
approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named

purposes of this clause (ii), considered as though such person were a member 
of the Incumbent Board.

1.7  Deferrable Amount

"Deferrable Amount" means an amount equal to the excess of the Eligible 
Employee's individual annual salary rate as of August 1 of any year over the 
Minimum Compensation Level.  

1.8  Deferred Compensation Account

selected annually by the Compensation Committee whose individual annual 
salary rate as of August 1 is equal to or greater than the Eligibility

above.  However, in no event shall a non-resident alien be eligible to

less than the Eligibility Compensation Level, shall nevertheless be eligible 
to participate in such year.

7.1  Elections

     A.   In General.  Subject to Section 7.1(B), a SOG Participant may make

          his or her Accounts be transferred to his or her other Account, 
          effective as of the close of business on the last day of any 
          calendar month (hereinafter the election's "Effective Date"), by 
          filing a written election with the Compensation Committee on or 
          prior to such date.

     B.   Elections to Defer For A Fixed Period During Employment.  A SOG 
          Participant may not transfer to his or her Stock Account any amount 
          subject to an election to defer for a fixed number of years 
          pursuant to Article 6, nor may he or she transfer to his or her 
          Stock Account any interest that has accrued on such amount.

7.2  Election into the Stock Account

If a SOG Participant makes an investment election pursuant to Section 7.1 to 
transfer an amount from his or her Deferred Compensation Account to his or 
her Stock Account, effective as of the election's Effective Date, (i) his or 
her Stock Account shall be credited with that number of units of Common 
Stock, and fractions thereof, obtained by dividing the dollar amount elected 
to be transferred by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the Valuation 
Date coincident with or immediately preceding the election's Effective Date; 
and (ii) his or her Deferred Compensation Account shall be reduced by the 
amount elected to be transferred.

<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 64

7.3  Election out of the Stock Account

If a SOG Participant makes an investment election pursuant to Section 7.1 to 
transfer an amount from his or her Stock Account to his or her Deferred 
Compensation Account, effective as of the election's Effective Date, (i) his 
or her Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited with a dollar amount 
equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the number of units to be 
transferred by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the Valuation Date 
coincident with or immediately preceding the election's Effective Date; and 
(ii) his or her Stock account shall be reduced by the number of units elected 
to be transferred.

7.4  Dividend Equivalents

Effective as of the payment date for each cash dividend on the Common Stock, 
additional units of Common Stock shall be credited to the Stock Account of 
each SOG Participant who had a balance in his or her Stock Account on the 
record date for such dividend.  The number of units that shall be credited to 
the Stock Account of such a SOG Participant shall be computed by multiplying 
the dollar value of the dividend paid upon a single share of Common Stock by 
the number of units of Common Stock held in the SOG Participant's Stock 
Account on the record date for such dividend and dividing the product thereof 
by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date for such 
dividend.

7.5  Stock Dividends

Effective as of the payment date for each stock dividend (as defined in 
Section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) on the Common Stock, 
additional units of Common Stock shall be credited to the Stock Account of 
each SOG Participant who had a balance in his or her Stock Account on the 
record date for such dividend.  The number of units that shall be credited to 
the Stock Account of such a SOG Participant shall equal the number of shares 
of Common Stock which the SOG Participant would have received as stock 
dividends had he or she been the owner on the record date for such stock 
dividend of the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of units 
credited to his or her Stock Account on such record date.  To the extent the 
SOG Participant would have also received cash, in lieu of fractional shares 
of Common Stock, had he or she been the record owner of such shares for such 
stock dividend, then his or her Stock Account shall also be credited with 
that number of units, or fractions thereof, equal to such cash amount divided 
by the Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date for 
such dividend.

7.6  Recapitalization

If Kodak undergoes a reorganization as defined in Section 368 (a) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole 
and absolute discretion, take whatever action it deems necessary, advisable 
or appropriate with respect to the Stock Accounts in order to reflect such 
transaction, including, but not limited to, adjusting the number of units 
credited to a SOG Participant's Stock Account.

7.7  Distributions

Amounts in respect of units of Common Stock shall be distributed in cash in 
accordance with Articles 6, 8 and 11.  For purposes of a distribution 
pursuant to Article 6, 8, or 11, the number of units to be distributed from a 
SOG Participant's Stock Account shall be valued by multiplying the number of 
such units by the Market Value of the Common Stock as of the Valuation Date 
coincident with or immediately preceding the date such distribution is to 
occur.  Pending the complete distribution under Section 8.2 or liquidation 
under Section 7.8 of the Stock Account of a SOG Participant who has 
terminated his or her employment with the Company, the SOG Participant shall 
continue to be able to make elections pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.3 and 
his or her Stock Account shall continue to be credited with additional units 
of Common Stock pursuant to Sections 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6.

7.8  Liquidation of Stock Account

The provisions of this Section 7.8 shall be applicable if on the second 
anniversary of the SOG Participant's retirement or, if earlier, termination 
of employment from the Company, the SOG Participant has a balance remaining 
in his or her Stock Account.  In such case, effective as of the first day of 
the first calendar month immediately following the date of such second 
anniversary, the entire balance of the SOG Participant's Stock Account shall 
automatically be transferred to his or her Deferred Compensation Account and, 
he or she shall thereafter be ineligible to transfer any amounts to his or 
her Stock Account.  For purposes of valuing the units of Common Stock subject 
to such a transfer, the method described in Section 7.3 shall be used.


Article 8.     Payment of Deferred Compensation

8.1  Background

No withdrawal may be made from a Participant's Accounts except as provided in 
this Article 8 and Articles 6 and 13.

8.2  Manner of Payment

Payment of a Participant's Accounts shall be made at the sole discretion of 
the Compensation Committee in a single sum or in annual installments; 
provided, however, that payment in the event of death shall be made in 
accordance with Section 8.6.  The maximum number of installments is ten.  All 
payments from the Plan shall be made in cash.

8.3  Timing

Payments shall be made as soon as is administratively possible following the 
fifth business day in March and shall commence in any year designated by the

the Participant retires, becomes disabled, or for any other reason, ceases to 
be an employee of Kodak or any subsidiary of Kodak, but in no event later 
than the year the Participant reaches age 71.  Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence of this Section 8.3, payment in the event of death shall be made in 
accordance with Section 8.6.

8.4  Valuation

The amount of each payment shall be equal to the value, as of the immediately 
preceding Valuation Date, of the Participant's Accounts, divided by the 
number of installments remaining to be paid.  If payment of a Participant's 
Accounts is determined by the Compensation Committee to be paid in 
installments and the Participant has a balance in his or her Stock Account at 
the time of the payment of an installment, the amount that shall be 
distributed from his or her Stock Account shall be the amount obtained by 
multiplying the total amount of the installment determined in accordance with 
the immediately preceding sentence by the percentage obtained by dividing the 
balance in the Stock Account as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date 
by the total value of the Participant's Accounts as of such date.  Similarly, 
in such case, the amount that shall be distributed from the Participant's 
Deferred Compensation Account shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the 
total amount of the installment determined in accordance with the first 
sentence of this Section 8.4 by the percentage obtained by dividing the 
balance in the Deferred Compensation Account as of the immediately preceding 
Valuation Date by the total value of the Participant's Accounts as of such 
date.

8.5  Termination of Employment

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Participants who cease to be 
employed by Kodak or any Subsidiary of Kodak and are employed by Eastman 
Chemical Company or one of its subsidiaries in connection with the 
distribution of the common stock of Eastman Chemical Company to the 
shareholders of Kodak, shall not be deemed to have terminated employment for 
purposes of this Plan.

8.6  Payment of Deferred Compensation After Death

If a Participant dies prior to complete payment of his or her Accounts, the 
provisions of this Section 8.6 shall become operative.

     A.   Stock Account.  Effective as of the date of a SOG Participant's 
          death, the entire balance of his or her Stock Account shall be 
          transferred to his or her Deferred Compensation Account.  For 
          purposes of valuing the units of Common Stock subject to such a 
          transfer, the deceased SOG Participant's Deferred Compensation 
          Account shall be credited with a dollar amount equal to the amount 
          obtained by multiplying the number of units in the deceased SOG 
          Participant's Stock Account at the time of his or her death by the 
          Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of his or her death.  
          Thereafter, no amounts in the deceased SOG Participant's Deferred 
          Compensation Account shall be eligible for transfer to the deceased 
          SOG Participant's Stock Account by any person, including, but not 
          by way of limitation, the deceased SOG Participant's beneficiary or 
          legal representative.

     B.   Distribution.  The balance of the Participant's Accounts, valued as 
          of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the date payment is 
          made, shall be paid in a single, lump-sum payment to: (1) the 
          beneficiary or contingent beneficiary designated by the Participant 
          on forms supplied by the Compensation Committee; or, in the absence 
          of a valid designation of a beneficiary or contingent beneficiary, 
          (2) the Participant's estate within 30 days after appointment of a 
          legal representative of the deceased Participant.

8.7  Acceleration of Payment for Hardship

Upon written approval from Kodak's Chairman of the Board (the Compensation 
Committee, in the case of a request from the Chairman of the Board) a 
Participant, whether or not he or she is still employed by Kodak or any 
subsidiary of Kodak, may be permitted to receive all or part of his or her 
Accounts if the Chairman of the Board (or the Compensation Committee, when 
applicable) determines that an emergency event beyond the Participant's 
control exists which would cause such Participant severe financial hardship 
if the payment of his or her Accounts were not approved.  Any such 
distribution for hardship shall be limited to the amount needed to meet such 
emergency.  If such a distribution occurs while the Participant is employed 
by Kodak or any subsidiary of Kodak, any election to defer compensation for 
the year in which the Participant receives a hardship withdrawal shall be 
ineffective as to compensation earned for the pay period following the pay 
period during which the withdrawal is made and thereafter for the remainder 
of such year and shall be ineffective as to any wage dividend or any other 
compensation elected to be deferred for such year.

payment shall be made as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 
days after the date of the Change in Control.

11.3 Amendment On or After Change In Control

On or after a Change in Control, no action, including, but not by way of

this Plan with respect to the balance in the Participant's Accounts.


Article 12.    Severance Payments

With the exception of Articles 1 and 9 hereof and Sections 10.2, 10.3, 10.5, 
10.6, and 10.8 hereof, the provisions of this Article 12 shall operate 
independent of any other Sections of this Plan.

Subject to the terms and conditions established in this Article 12, the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company may award severance payments under the Plan 
to certain Eligible Employees who terminate their employment from the 
Company.  The classification of Eligible Employees who are eligible for such 
severance payments shall be limited to those Eligible Employees who are 
officers of the Company.  The amount of any such severance payment shall be 
determined by the Chief Executive Officer with reference to the Eligible 
Employee's base salary at the time of his or her termination of employment.  
The Chief Executive Officer shall have the sole discretion to determine the 
timing, manner of payment (e.g., lump sum or installments) and terms, 
conditions and limitations of any such severance payment, except that all 
such payments shall be made in cash.  Any award made by the Chief Executive 
Officer pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be evidenced by a 
written agreement signed by the Chief Executive Officer.

3.  Administration

This Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  The Committee is 
authorized to establish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary for 
the proper administration of the Plan, and to make such determinations and 
interpretations and to take such action in connection with the Plan and any 
options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Plan as it deems 
necessary or advisable. All determinations of the Committee shall be by a 
majority of its members, and its determinations shall be final.

receive grants under the Plan.  Directors of the Company or any Subsidiary 
who are not full-time employees of the Company or Subsidiary shall not be

5.  Shares Available

An aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of common stock (par value $2.50) of the 
Company shall be available for grant under the Plan (subject to adjustment as 
provided in paragraph 10). Such shares may be authorized and unissued shares 
or may be treasury shares.  Upon the expiration or termination in whole or in

unexercised grant shall be available again for grant under the Plan.

6.  Grant of Options

Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 7 and 8, options may be granted to 
such eligible employees in such numbers, at such times during the term of the 
Plan, and for such durations as the Committee shall determine.  These stock 
options may be incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422A of 
the Internal Revenue Code or non-qualified stock options (i.e., stock options 
which are not incentive stock options), or a combination of both.  Options 
may contain dissimilar provisions provided that all such provisions are 
consistent with the Plan.

7.  Terms and Conditions of Grants

     (a)  All options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the  
following terms and conditions:

          (i)  Option Price -- The option price shall be not less than 100%     
          of the fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the  
          Committee, on the date of grant.

          (ii) Duration of Options -- Each option shall expire not later than   
          ten years from the date of grant, unless sooner exercised or          
          terminated in accordance with subparagraph (vi) or (vii) below.

          (iii) Exercise of An Option -- No option may be exercised within      
          one year of the date on which the option is granted.  One half
          (50%) of an option shall become exercisable on the first
          anniversary of the date of grant of such option and the remaining
          half shall become exercisable on the second anniversary of the
          date of grant.

          Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, if any Participant       
          dies, becomes disabled, retires or terminates employment for any
          approved reason, prior to the second anniversary of the date of
          grant of any options to him, such options may be exercised at any
          time between the date of the event and the date of termination of
          the option indicated by its terms.  Options may be exercised from
          time to time by written notice to the Company stating the number
          of shares with respect to which the option is being exercised.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 73


          (iv)  Payment -- No shares shall be issued or delivered until full    
          payment for the shares has been made, with cash, with Company
          shares valued as of the date of exercise (including shares
          previously acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option),
          or with a combination of both.

          (v)  Nontransferability of Options -- An option shall not be          
          transferable by a Participant except by will or the 
          laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable, during 
          his lifetime, only by him.

          (vi)  Termination of Employment -- On the sixtieth (60th) day after   
          termination of a Participant's employment, each option previously     
          granted to him shall expire; provided, however, if employment is
          terminated by reason of death, disability, retirement or any 
          approved reason, the option shall terminate at such time as 
          determined by the Committee.  Transfers between the Company and a
          Subsidiary shall not be a termination of employment.  Anything
          herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Participants who cease to
          be employed by the Company or a Subsidiary and are employed by
          Eastman Chemical Company or one of its subsidiaries in connection
          with the distribution of the common stock of Eastman Chemical
          Company to the shareholders of the Company, shall not be deemed to
          have terminated employment for purposes of this Plan and all 
          options and SARs outstanding on the date of such distribution.

          (vii)  Non-Competitive Provision -- Notwithstanding any Plan          
          provision, other than Paragraph 18.07 hereof, to the contrary,
          if a Participant, without the written consent of the Company,
          engages either directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity,
          as principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, or
          otherwise, in any business or activity competitive with the
          business conducted by the Company or any Subsidiary, or performs
          any act or engages in any activity which, in the opinion of the 
          Chief Executive Officer, is inimical to the best interests of the
          Company, either during or after employment with the Company or
          Subsidiary, all options previously granted to him shall expire
          forthwith.

     (b)  In addition to the terms and conditions of paragraph (a) above,  
     incentive stock options granted under the Plan shall also be subject to
     the following: If a Participant disposes of shares acquired pursuant to
     the exercise of an incentive stock option in a disqualifying
     disposition  within the time periods identified in Section 422A(a)(l)
     of the Internal Revenue Code, such Participant is required to notify
     the Company of such disposition and provide information as to the date
     of disposition, sale price, quantity disposed of and any other
     information about such disposition which the Company may reasonably
     request.

8.  Stock Appreciation Rights

Stock appreciation rights covering shares of Common Stock ("SARs") may be 
granted to such eligible employees in such numbers and at such times during 
the term of the Plan as the Committee shall determine.  An SAR may be granted 
in tandem with all or a portion of a related stock option under the Plan 
("Tandem SARs"), or may be granted separately ("Freestanding SAR").  Tandem 
SARs shall be granted concurrently with the grant of the stock option.  A 
Tandem SAR shall be exercisable only to the extent that the related stock 
option is exercisable, and the "exercise price" of such an SAR (the base from 
which the value of the SAR is measured at its exercise) shall be the option 
price under the related stock option.  The exercise price of a Freestanding 
SAR shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock, 
as determined by the Committee, on the date of grant of the Freestanding SAR.  
A Tandem SAR and a Freestanding SAR shall entitle the recipient to

                                                               <PAGE> 74

receive a payment equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares 
of Common Stock covered by the SAR on the date of exercise over the exercise 
price of the SAR.  Such payment may be made in cash or in shares of Common 
Stock or a combination of both, as the Committee shall determine.  The 
Committee may cancel or place a limit on the term of, or the amount payable 
for, any SAR at any time.  The Committee shall determine all other terms and 
conditions of any SAR grant.  An SAR shall not be transferable by a 
Participant except by will or the laws of descent- and distribution and shall 
be exercisable, during his lifetime, only by him.  Unless the Committee shall 
otherwise determine, to the extent a Freestanding SAR is exercisable, it will 
be exercised automatically for a cash settlement on its expiration date.  
Upon exercise of a Tandem SAR as to some or all of the shares covered by the 
grant, the related stock option shall be cancelled automatically to the 
extent of the number of shares covered by such exercise, and such shares 
shall no longer be available for grant under Section 5.  Conversely, if the 
related stock option is exercised as to some or all of the shares covered by 
the grant, the related Tandem SAR, if any, shall be cancelled automatically 
to the extent of the number of shares covered by the stock option exercise.

 9.  Regulatory Approvals and Listing

The Company shall not be required to issue any certificate or certificates 
for shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an option or SAR prior to (a) 
the obtaining of any approval from any governmental agency which the Company 
shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable, (b) 
the admission of such shares to listing on any stock exchange on which the 
Common Stock may then be listed, and (c) the completion of any registration 
or other qualification of such shares under any state or Federal law or 
rulings or regulations of any governmental body which the Company shall, in 
its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.

10.  Adjustment of Shares Available

If there is any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of 
the Company through the declaration of stock dividends, or through stock 
splits, the number of shares available for options and SARs and the shares 
subject to any option or SAR and the option prices or exercise prices shall 
be automatically adjusted.  If there is any change in the number of 
outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company through any change in the 
capital account of the Company or through any other transaction referred to 
in Section 425(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the number of shares 
available for options and SARs and the shares subject to any option or SAR 
and the option prices or exercise prices shall be appropriately adjusted by 
the Committee.

11.  Prohibition of Loans to Participants

Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall directly or indirectly lend 
money to a Participant for the purpose of assisting him to exercise any 
option granted under the Plan.

12.  Amendment

The Board may from time to time amend the Plan in any manner which it deems 
in the best interest of the Company, but may not, without the approval of the 
Company's shareholders, adopt any amendment which would (a) materially 
increase the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan, (b) materially 
increase the maximum number of shares which may be issued under the Plan 
(other than pursuant to paragraph 10), or (c) materially modify the 
requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.

13.  Term

The Plan shall become effective on November 8, 1985, and shall be submitted 
for approval by the Company's shareholders at the 1986 annual meeting.  No 
option or SARs shall be exercisable before shareholder approval of the Plan.  
No option or SAR shall be granted pursuant to the Plan after December 31, 
1989.

14.  Rights as a Shareholder

A Participant shall possess no rights as a shareholder with respect to the 
shares covered by an option or SAR granted to him until the issuance to the 
Participant of the stock certificate for the shares purchased.

15.  Governing Law

The Plan shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the law of New 
York State.

16.  Taxes

The Company will withhold, to the extent required by law, all applicable 
income and employment taxes due as a result of transactions under this Plan 
and the Company may require the Participant to pay to it such tax as a 
condition of exercise of an option or SAR.

17.  No Right to Continued Employment

Participation in the Plan shall not give any employee any right to remain in 
the employ of the Company.  The Company reserves the right to terminate any 
Participant at any time.

18.  Change In Control

     18.01     Background.  The terms of this Paragraph 18 shall immediately 
               become operative, without further action or consent by any 
               person or entity, upon a Change In Control, and once operative 
               shall supersede and control over any other provisions of this 
               Plan and its Administrative Guide.

     18.02     Lapse of Restrictions.  Upon a Change In Control, all terms, 
               conditions or restrictions in effect on any outstanding stock 
               options, regardless of whether such stock options are 
               incentive stock options or non- qualified stock options, or 
               SARs, regardless of whether such SARs are Tandem SARs or 
               Freestanding SARs, shall immediately lapse as of the date of 
               the event.

               In addition, no other terms, conditions, or restrictions shall 
               be imposed on any stock options or SARs on or after such date.

     18.03     Vesting of Stock Options and SARs.  Upon a Change In Control, 
               all outstanding stock options and SARs shall automatically 
               become one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately upon the 
               occurrence of such event.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 76


     18.04     Exercise and Payment of Freestanding SARs.  Upon a Change In 
               Control, all outstanding -Freestanding SARs shall 
               automatically be exercised, without further action by the 
               Committee or any Participant, immediately upon the occurrence 
               of such event.  As a result, any Participant, whether or not 
               he is still employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, then 
               holding any outstanding Freestanding SARs shall be paid the 
               value of his or her Freestanding SARs in a single lump-sum 
               cash payment as soon as practicable, but in no event later 
               than 90 days after the date of the Change In Control.  For 
               purposes of making this payment, the value of such 
               Participant's Freestanding SARs shall be determined by 
               averaging the mean between the high and low at which Kodak 
               common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
               day of the Change In Control.

     18.05     Cash Surrender of Stock Options.  Upon the occurrence of a 
               Change In Control, any Participant, whether or not he is still 
               employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, then holding any 
               stock options, regardless of whether they are incentive stock 
               options or non-qualified stock options, shall be paid in a 
               single lump-sum cash payment the "Change In Control Value," as 
               that term is hereafter defined, of such stock options as soon 
               as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the 
               date of the Change In Control.  For purposes of this Paragraph 
               18, the "Change In Control Value" of a given stock option 
               shall be determined by multiplying the total number of shares 
               of common stock the Participant would then be entitled to 
               purchase under such option (assuming the application of 
               Subparagraphs 18.02 and 18.03 hereof) by the amount resulting 
               from subtracting the option price of such stock option from 
               the stock value obtained by averaging the mean between the 
               high and low at which Kodak common stock is traded on the New 
               York Stock Exchange on the date of the Change In Control.

               Upon receipt of the foregoing lump sum cash payment by a 
               Participant, the outstanding stock options for which such 
               payment is being made, as well as the Tandem SARs related to 
               such stock options, shall be automatically cancelled.

     18.06     Amendment on or After Change In Control.  On or after a Change 
               in Control, no action, including, but not by way of 
               limitation, the amendment, suspension or termination of the 
               Plan, shall be taken which would affect the rights of any 
               Participant or the operation of this Plan with respect to any 
               stock options or SARs to which the Participant may have become 
               entitled hereunder on or prior to the date of such action or 
               as a result of such Change In Control.

     18.07     Subparagraphs 7(a)(vi) and 7(a)(vii).  Upon a Change In 
               Control, the terms and provisions of Subparagraphs 7(a)(vi) 
               and 7(a)(vii) shall become null and void and shall have no 
               further force and effect.

the authority to:  (a) interpret the Plan; (b) establish such rules and 
regulations as it deems necessary for the proper operation and administration 
of the Plan; (c) select Key Employees to receive Awards under the Plan; (d)

right, Stock Award, performance unit, performance share, or other incentive 
award established by the Committee in accordance with (h) below, the number 
of shares or Units subject to the Award, all the terms, conditions, 
restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of an Award, including the time and 
conditions of exercise or vesting, and the terms of any Award Notice; (e) 
determine whether Awards should be granted singly, in combination or in

the best interest of the Company; (h) establish such other types of Awards, 
besides those specifically enumerated in paragraph 2.1 hereof, which the 
Committee determines are consistent with the Plan's purpose; and (i) take any 
and all other action it deems necessary or advisable for the proper operation 
or administration of the Plan.  In addition, in order to enable Key Employees 
who are foreign nationals or are employed outside the United States or both 
to receive Awards under the Plan, the Committee may adopt such amendments, 
procedures, regulations, subplans and the like as are necessary or advisable, 
in the opinion of the Committee, to effectuate the purposes of the Plan.  The 
Committee shall also have the authority to grant Awards in replacement of 
Awards previously granted under this Plan or any other executive compensation 
plan of the Company or a Subsidiary.  All determinations of the Committee 
shall be made by a majority of its members, and its determinations shall be 
final, binding and conclusive.

The Committee, in its discretion, may delegate its authority and duties under 
the Plan to the Chief Executive Officer and/or to other senior officers of 
the Company under such conditions and/or limitations as the Committee may 
establish; provided, however, that only the Committee may select and grant 
Awards to Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.


4.   Eligibility

Any Key Employee is eligible to become a Participant of the Plan.

In addition, any individual who on the effective date of the Plan is both (i) 
a former Key Employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, and (ii) a participant 
under the Eastman Kodak Company 1985 Long-Term Performance Award Plan (the 
"1985 Plan"), shall be eligible to become a Participant of the Plan.  
However, the participation of any such individual under the Plan shall be 
limited solely to receiving Awards granted by the Committee under this Plan 
in replacement of any unpaid or unearned award under the 1985 Plan on the 
effective date of the Plan.


5.   Shares Available

The maximum number of shares of Common Stock, $2.50 par value per share, of 
the Company which shall be available for grant of Awards under the Plan 
(including incentive stock options) during its term shall not exceed 
Twenty-Two Million Thirty-Three Thousand and Six Hundred (22,033,600).  (Such 
amount shall be subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph 18.)  Any 
shares of Common Stock related to Awards which terminate by expiration, 
forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of such shares, 
are settled in cash in lieu of Common Stock, or are exchanged with the 
Committee's permission for Awards not involving Common Stock, shall be 
available again for grant under the Plan.  Further, any shares of Common 
Stock which are used by a Participant for the full or partial payment to the 
Company of the purchase price of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of a 
stock option, or for any withholding taxes due as a result of such exercise, 
shall again be available for Awards under the Plan.  Similarly, shares of 
Common Stock with respect to which an SAR has been exercised and paid in cash 
shall again be eligible for grant under the Plan.  The shares of Common Stock 
available for issuance under the Plan may be authorized and unissued shares 
or treasury shares.

6.   Term

The Plan shall become effective as of February 1, 1990, subject to its 
approval by the Company's shareholders at the 1990 annual meeting.  No awards 
shall be exercisable or payable before approval of the Plan has been obtained 
from the Company's shareholders.  Awards shall not be granted pursuant to the 
Plan after January 31, 1995.


7.   Participation

The Committee shall select, from time to time, Participants from those Key 
Employees who, in the opinion of the Committee, can further the Plan's 
purposes.  Once a Participant is so selected, the Committee shall determine 
the type or types of Awards to be made to the Participant and shall establish 
in the related Award Notices the terms, conditions, restrictions and/or 
limitations, if any, applicable to the Awards in addition to those set forth 
in this Plan and the administrative rules and regulations issued by the 
Committee.


8.   Stock Options

     (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of stock options.  These 
          stock options may be incentive stock options within the meaning of 
          Section 422A of the Code or non-qualified stock options (i.e., 
          stock options which are not incentive stock options), or a 
          combination of both.

     (b)  Terms and Conditions of Options.  An option shall be exercisable in 
          whole or in such installments and at such times as may be 
          determined by the Committee.  The price at which Common Stock may 
          be purchased upon exercise of a stock option shall be established 
          by the Committee, but such price shall not be less than 50 percent 
          of the fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the 
          Committee, on the date of the stock option's grant.

     (c)  Restrictions Relating to Incentive Stock Options.  Stock options 
          issued in the form of incentive stock options shall, in addition to 
          being subject to all applicable terms, conditions, restrictions 
          and/or limitations established by the Committee, comply with 
          Section 422A of the Code.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair market 
          value (determined at the time the option was granted) of the Common 
          Stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable 
          for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under 
          this Plan or any other plan of the Company or any of its 
          Subsidiaries) shall not exceed $100,000 (or such other limit as may 
          be required by the Code).  Further, the per-share option price of 
          an incentive stock option shall not be less than 100 percent of the 
          fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the 
          Committee, on the date of grant.  Also, each option shall expire 
          not later than ten years from its date of grant.  The number of 
          shares of Common Stock that shall be available for incentive stock 
          options granted under the Plan is 16,000,000.

     (d)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
          Award Notice or otherwise, establish such other terms, conditions, 
          restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any stock option Award, 
          provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan.

     (e)  Exercise.  Upon exercise, the option price of a stock option may be 
          paid in cash, shares of Common Stock, shares of restricted Common 
          Stock, a combination of the foregoing, or such other consideration 
          as the Committee may deem appropriate.  The Committee shall 
          establish appropriate methods for accepting Common Stock, whether 
          restricted or unrestricted, and may impose such conditions as it 
          deems appropriate on the use of such Common Stock to exercise a 
          stock option.

9.   Stock Appreciation Rights

     (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of stock appreciation 
          rights ("SARs").  An SAR may be granted in tandem with all or a 
          portion of a related stock option under the Plan ("Tandem SARs"), 
          or may be granted separately ("Freestanding SARs").  A Tandem SAR 
          may be granted either at the time of the grant of the related stock 
          option or at any time thereafter during the term of the stock 
          option.  SARs shall entitle the recipient to receive a payment 
          equal to the appreciation in market value of a stated number of 
          shares of Common Stock from the exercise price to the market value 
          on the date of exercise.  In the case of SARs granted in tandem 
          with stock options granted prior to the grant of such SARs, the 
          appreciation in value is from the option price of such related 
          stock option to the market value on the date of exercise.

     (b)  Terms and Conditions of Tandem SARs.  A Tandem SAR shall be 
          exercisable to the extent, and only to the extent, that the related 
          stock option is exercisable, and the "exercise price" of such an 
          SAR (the base from which the value of the SAR is measured at its 
          exercise) shall be the option price under the related stock option.  
          However, at no time shall a Tandem SAR be issued if the option 
          price of its related stock option is less than 50 percent of the 
          fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the 
          Committee, on the date of the Tandem SAR's grant.  If a related 
          stock option is exercised as to some or all of the shares covered 
          by the Award, the related Tandem SAR, if any, shall be cancelled 
          automatically to the extent of the number of shares covered by the 
          stock option exercise.  Upon exercise of a Tandem SAR as to some or 
          all of the shares covered by the Award, the related stock option 
          shall be cancelled automatically to the extent of the number of 
          shares covered by such exercise, and such shares shall again be 
          eligible for grant in accordance with paragraph 5 hereof, except to 
          the extent any shares of Common Stock are issued to settle the SAR.

     (c)  Terms and Conditions of Freestanding SARs.  Freestanding SARs shall 
          be exercisable in whole or in such installments and at such times 
          as may be determined by the Committee.  The exercise price of a 
          Freestanding SAR shall also be determined by the Committee; 
          provided, however, that such price shall not be less than 50 
          percent of the fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined 
          by the Committee, on the date of the Freestanding SAR's grant.

     (d)  Deemed Exercise.  The Committee may provide that an SAR shall be 
          deemed to be exercised at the close of business on the scheduled 
          expiration date of such SAR if at such time the SAR by its terms 
          remains exercisable and, if so exercised, would result in a payment 
          to the holder of such SAR.

     (e)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
          Award Notice or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, 
          restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any SAR Award, provided 
          they are not inconsistent with the Plan.


10.  Stock Awards

     (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of Stock Awards.  Stock 
          Awards shall be awarded in such numbers and at such times during 
          the term of the Plan as the Committee shall determine.

     (b)  Award Restrictions.  Stock Awards shall be subject to such terms, 
          conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, as the 
          Committee deems appropriate including, but not by way of 
          limitation, restrictions on transferability and continued 
          employment.  The Committee may modify or accelerate the delivery of 
          a Stock Award under such circumstances as it deems appropriate.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 84


     (c)  Rights as Shareholders.  During the period in which any restricted 
          shares of Common Stock are subject to the restrictions imposed 
          under paragraph 10(b), the Committee may, in its discretion, grant 
          to the Participant to whom such restricted shares have been awarded 
          all or any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such 
          shares, including, but not by way of limitation, the right to vote 
          such shares and to receive dividends.

     (d)  Evidence of Award.  Any stock award granted under the Plan may be 
          evidenced in such manner as the Committee deems appropriate, 
          including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance 
          of a stock certificate or certificates.


11.  Performance Units

     (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of performance units.  
          Performance units, as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer 
          to Units valued by reference to designated criteria established by 
          the Committee, other than Common Stock.

     (b)  Performance Criteria.  Performance units shall be contingent on the 
          attainment during a performance period of certain performance 
          objectives.  The length of the performance period, the performance 
          objectives to be achieved during the performance period, and the 
          measure of whether and to what degree such objectives have been 
          attained shall be conclusively determined by the Committee in the 
          exercise of its absolute discretion.  Performance objectives may be 
          revised by the Committee, at such times as it deems appropriate 
          during the performance period, in order to take into consideration 
          any unforeseen events or changes in circumstances.

     (c)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
          Award Notice or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, 
          restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of 
          performance units, provided they are not inconsistent with the 
          Plan.


12.  Performance Shares

     (a)  Grants.  Awards may be granted in the form of performance shares.  
          Performance shares, as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer 
          to shares of Common Stock or Units which are expressed in terms of 
          Common Stock.

     (b)  Performance Criteria.  Performance shares shall be contingent upon 
          the attainment during a performance period of certain performance 
          objectives.  The length of the performance period, the performance 
          objectives to be achieved during the performance period, and the 
          measure of whether and to what degree such objectives have been 
          attained shall be conclusively determined by the Committee in the 
          exercise of its absolute discretion.  Performance objectives may be 
          revised by the Committee, at such times as it deems appropriate 
          during the performance period, in order to take into consideration 
          any unforeseen events or changes in circumstances.

     (c)  Additional Terms and Conditions.  The Committee may, by way of the 
          Award Notice or otherwise, determine such other terms, conditions, 
          restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any Award of 
          performance shares, provided they are not inconsistent with the 
          Plan.

13.  Payment of Awards

At the discretion of the Committee, payment of Awards may be made in cash, 
Common Stock, a combination of cash and Common Stock, or any other form of 
property as the Committee shall determine.  In addition, payment of Awards may 
include such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as 
the Committee deems appropriate, including, in the case of Awards paid in the 
form of Common Stock, restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provisions.  
Further, payment of Awards may be made in the form of a lump sum or 
installments, as determined by the Committee.


14.  Dividends and Dividend Equivalents

If an Award is granted in the form of a Stock Award, stock option, or 
performance share, or in the form of any other stock-based grant, the 
Committee may choose, at the time of the grant of the Award or any time 
thereafter up to the time of the Award's payment, to include as part of such 
Award an entitlement to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, subject to 
such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as the 
Committee may establish.  Dividends and dividend equivalents shall be paid in 
such form and manner (i.e., lump sum or installments), and at such time as the 
Committee shall determine.  All dividends or dividend equivalents which are 
not paid currently may, at the Committee's discretion, accrue interest, be 
reinvested into additional shares of Common Stock or, in the case of dividends 
or dividend equivalents credited in connection with performance shares, be 
credited as additional performance shares and paid to the Participant if and 
when, and to the extent that, payment is made pursuant to such Award.


15.  Deferral of Awards

At the discretion of the Committee, payment of a Stock Award, performance 
share, performance unit, dividend, dividend equivalent, or any portion thereof 
may be deferred by a Participant until such time as the Committee may 
establish.  All such deferrals shall be accomplished by the delivery of a 
written, irrevocable election by the Participant prior to the time such 
payment would otherwise be made, on a form provided by the Company.  Further, 
all deferrals shall be made in accordance with administrative guidelines 
established by the Committee to ensure that such deferrals comply with all 
applicable requirements of the Code and its regulations.  Deferred payments 
shall be paid in a lump sum or installments, as determined by the Committee.  
The Committee may also credit interest, at such rates to be determined by the 
Committee, on cash payments that are deferred and credit dividends or dividend 
equivalents on deferred payments denominated in the form of Common Stock.


16.  Termination of Employment

If a Participant's employment with the Company or a Subsidiary terminates for 
a reason other than death, disability, retirement, or any approved reason, all 
unexercised, unearned, and/or unpaid Awards, including, but not by way of 
limitation, Awards earned but not yet paid, all unpaid dividends and dividend 
equivalents, and all interest accrued on the foregoing shall be cancelled or 
forfeited, as the case may be, unless the Participant's Award Notice provides 
otherwise.  The Committee shall have the authority to promulgate rules and 
regulations to (i) determine what events constitute disability, retirement, or 
termination for an approved reason for purposes of the Plan, and (ii) 
determine the treatment of a Participant under the Plan in the event of his 
death, disability, retirement or termination for an approved reason.  Anything 
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Participants who cease to be employed 
by the Company or a Subsidiary and are employed by Eastman Chemical Company or 
one of its subsidiaries in connection with the distribution of the common 
stock of Eastman Chemical Company to the shareholders of the Company, shall 
not be deemed to have terminated employment for purposes of this Plan and all 
Awards outstanding on the date of such distribution.

17.  Nonassignability

No Awards or any other payment under the Plan shall be subject in any manner 
to alienation, anticipation, sale, transfer (except by will or the laws of 
descent and distribution), assignment, pledge, or encumbrance, nor shall any 
Award be payable to or exercisable by anyone other than the Participant to 
whom it was granted.


18.  Adjustment of Shares Available

If there is any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock 
through the declaration of stock dividends, stock splits or the like, the 
number of shares available for Awards, the shares subject to any Award and the 
option prices or exercise prices of Awards shall be automatically adjusted.  
If there is any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock 
through any change in the capital account of the Company, or through any other 
transaction referred to in Section 425(a) of the Code, the Committee shall 
make appropriate adjustments in the maximum number of shares of Common Stock 
which may be issued under the Plan and any adjustments and/or modifications to 
outstanding Awards as it deems appropriate.  In the event of any other change 
in the capital structure or in the Common Stock of the Company, the Committee 
shall also be authorized to make such appropriate adjustments in the maximum 
number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan and any 
adjustments and/or modifications to outstanding Awards as it deems 
appropriate.


19.  Withholding Taxes

The Company shall be entitled to deduct from any payment under the Plan, 
regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income 
and employment taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such 
payment or may require the Participant to pay to it such tax prior to and as a 
condition of the making of such payment.  In accordance with any applicable 
administrative guidelines it establishes, the Committee may allow a 
Participant to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld from an 
Award by withholding from any payment of Common Stock due as a result of such 
Award, or by permitting the Participant to deliver to the Company, shares of 
Common Stock having a fair market value, as determined by the Committee, equal 
to the amount of such required withholding taxes.


20.  Noncompetition Provision

Unless the Award Notice specifies otherwise, a Participant shall forfeit all 
unexercised, unearned, and/or unpaid Awards, including, but not by way of 
limitation, Awards earned but not yet paid, all unpaid dividends and dividend 
equivalents, and all interest, if any, accrued on the foregoing if, (i) in the 
opinion of the Committee, the Participant, without the written consent of the 
Company, engages directly or indirectly in any manner or capacity as 
principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, or otherwise, in any 
business or activity competitive with the business conducted by the Company or 
any Subsidiary; or (ii) the Participant performs any act or engages in any 
activity which in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is 
inimical to the best interests of the Company.  In addition, the Committee 
may, in its discretion, condition the deferral of any Award, dividend, or 
dividend equivalent under paragraph 15 hereof on a Participant's compliance 
with the terms of this paragraph 20, and cause such a Participant to forfeit 
any payment which is so deferred if the Participant fails to comply with the 
terms hereof.

21.  Amendments to Awards

The Committee may at any time unilaterally amend any unexercised, unearned, or 
unpaid Award, including, but not by way of limitation, Awards earned but not 
yet paid, to the extent it deems appropriate; provided, however, that any such 
amendment which, in the opinion of the Committee, is adverse to the 
Participant shall require the Participant's consent.


22.  Regulatory Approvals and Listings

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Company 
shall have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates of Common Stock 
evidencing Stock Awards or any other Award resulting in the payment of Common 
Stock prior to (a) the obtaining of any approval from any governmental agency 
which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or 
advisable, (b) the admission of such shares to listing on the stock exchange 
on which the Common Stock may be listed, and (c) the completion of any 
registration or other qualification of said shares under any state or federal 
law or ruling of any governmental body which the Company shall, in its sole 
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.


23.  No Right to Continued Employment or Grants

Participation in the Plan shall not give any Key Employee any right to remain 
in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary.  The Company or, in the case 
of employment with a Subsidiary, the Subsidiary, reserves the right to 
terminate any Key Employee at any time.  Further, the adoption of this Plan 
shall not be deemed to give any Key Employee or any other individual any right 
to be selected as a Participant or to be granted an Award.


24.  Amendment

The Committee may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time.  In addition, the 
Committee may, from time to time, amend the Plan in any manner, but may not 
without shareholder approval adopt any amendment which would (a) materially 
increase the benefits accruing to Participants under the Plan, (b) materially 
increase the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the 
Plan (except as specified in paragraph 18), or (c) materially modify the 
requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan.


25.  Governing Law

The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the 
State of New York, except as superseded by applicable Federal Law.


26.  Change In Ownership

     (a)  Background.  Upon a Change In Ownership:  (i) the terms of this 
          paragraph 26 shall immediately become operative, without further 
          action or consent by any person or entity; (ii) all terms, 
          conditions, restrictions, and limitations in effect on any 
          unexercised, unearned, unpaid, and/or deferred Award, or any other 
          outstanding Award, shall immediately lapse as of the date of such 
          event; (iii) no other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or 
          limitations shall be imposed upon any Awards on or after such date, 
          and in no circumstance shall an Award be forfeited on or after such 
          date; (iv) all unexercised, unvested, unearned, and/or unpaid Awards 
          or any other outstanding Awards shall automatically become one 
          hundred percent (100%) vested immediately.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 88


     (b)  Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.  Upon a Change In Ownership, all 
          unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents and all interest accrued 
          thereon, if any, shall be treated and paid under this paragraph 26 
          in the identical manner and time as the Award under which such 
          dividends or dividend equivalents have been credited.  For example, 
          if upon a Change In Ownership, an Award under this paragraph 26 is 
          to be paid in a prorated fashion, all unpaid dividends and dividend 
          equivalents with respect to such Award shall be paid according to 
          the same formula used to determine the amount of such prorated 
          Award.

     (c)  Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares.  If a Change 
          In Ownership occurs during the term of one or more performance 
          periods for which the Committee has granted performance units and/or 
          performance shares (hereinafter a "current performance period"), the 
          term of each such performance period shall immediately terminate 
          upon the occurrence of such event.  Upon a Change In Ownership, for 
          each "current performance period" and each completed performance 
          period for which the Committee has not on or before such date made a 
          determination as to whether and to what degree the performance 
          objectives for such period have been attained (hereinafter a 
          "completed performance period"), it shall be assumed that the 
          performance objectives have been attained at a level of one hundred 
          percent (100%) or the equivalent thereof.

          A Participant in one or more "current performance periods" shall be 
          considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive, a 
          prorated portion of the Awards previously granted to him for each 
          such performance period.  Such prorated portion shall be determined 
          by multiplying the number of performance shares or performance 
          units, as the case may be, granted to the Participant by a fraction, 
          the numerator of which is the total number of whole and partial 
          years (with each partial year being treated as a whole year) that 
          have elapsed since the beginning of the performance period, and the 
          denominator of which is the total number of years in such 
          performance period.

          A Participant in one or more "completed performance periods" shall 
          be considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive 
          all the performance shares or performance units, as the case may be, 
          previously granted to him during each such performance period.

     (d)  Valuation of Awards.  Upon a Change In Ownership, all outstanding 
          Units of Common Stock, Freestanding SARs, stock options (including 
          incentive stock options), and performance shares (including those 
          earned as a result of the application of paragraph 26(c) above) and 
          all other outstanding stock-based Awards, including those granted by 
          the Committee pursuant to its authority under paragraph 3(h) hereof, 
          shall be valued and cashed out on the basis of the Change In Control 
          Price.

     (e)  Payment of Awards.  Upon a Change In Ownership, any Participant, 
          whether or not he is still employed by the Company or a Subsidiary, 
          shall be paid, in a single lump-sum cash payment, as soon as 
          practicable but in no event later than 90 days after the Change In 
          Ownership, all of his outstanding Units of Common Stock, 
          Freestanding SARs, stock options (including incentive stock 
          options), performance units (including those earned as a result of 
          the application of paragraph 26(c) above), and performance shares 
          (including those earned as a result of paragraph 26(c) above), and 
          all other outstanding Awards, including those granted by the 
          Committee pursuant to its authority under paragraph 3(h) hereof.

     (f)  Deferred Awards.  Upon a Change In Ownership, all Awards deferred 
          by a Participant under paragraph 15 hereof, but for which he has 
          not received payment as of such date, shall be paid to him in a 
          single lump-sum cash payment as soon as practicable, but in no 
          event later than 90 days after the Change In Ownership.  For 
          purposes of making such payment, the value of all Awards which are 
          stock based shall be determined by the Change In Control Price.


27.  Change In Control

     (a)  Background.  All Participants shall be eligible for the treatment 
          afforded by this Paragraph 27 if their employment terminates within 
          two years following a Change In Control, unless the termination is 
          due to (i) death, (ii) disability entitling the Participant to 
          benefits under his employer's long-term disability plan, (iii) 
          Cause, (iv) resignation other than (A) resignation from a declined 
          reassignment to a job that is not reasonably equivalent in 
          responsibility or compensation (as defined in the Company's 
          Termination Allowance Plan), or that is not in the same geographic 
          area (as defined in the Company's Termination Allowance Plan), or 
          (B) resignation within thirty days following a reduction in base 
          pay, or (v) retirement entitling the Participant to benefits under 
          his employer's retirement plan.

     (b)  Vesting and Lapse of Restrictions.  If a Participant is eligible 
          for treatment under this paragraph 27, (i) all of the terms, 
          conditions, restrictions, and limitations in effect on any of his 
          unexercised, unearned, unpaid and/or deferred Awards shall 
          immediately lapse as of the date of his termination of employment; 
          (ii) no other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations 
          shall be imposed upon any of his Awards on or after such date, and 
          in no event shall any of his Awards be forfeited on or after such 
          date; and (iii) all of his unexercised, unvested, unearned and/or 
          unpaid Awards shall automatically become one hundred percent (100%) 
          vested immediately upon his termination of employment.

     (c)  Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.  If a Participant is eligible 
          for treatment under this paragraph 27, all of his unpaid dividends 
          and dividend equivalents and all interest accrued thereon, if any, 
          shall be treated and paid under this Paragraph 27 in the identical 
          manner and time as the Award under which such dividends or dividend 
          equivalents have been credited.

     (d)  Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares.  If a 
          Participant holding either performance units or performance shares 
          is terminated under the conditions described in (a) above, the 
          provisions of this paragraph (d) shall determine the manner in 
          which such performance units and/or performance shares shall be 
          paid to him.  For purposes of making such payment, each "current 
          performance period," as that term is defined in paragraph 26(c) 
          hereof, shall be treated as terminating upon the date of the 
          Participant's termination of employment, and for each such "current 
          performance period" and each "completed performance period," as 
          that term is defined in paragraph 26(c) hereof, it shall be assumed 
          that the performance objectives have been attained at a level of 
          one hundred percent (100%) or the equivalent thereof.  If the 
          Participant is participating in one or more "current performance 
          periods," he shall be considered to have earned and, therefore, be 
          entitled to receive that prorated portion of the Awards previously 
          granted to him for each such performance period, as determined in 
          accordance with the formula established in paragraph 26(c) hereof.  
          A Participant in one or more "completed performance periods" shall 
          be considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive 
          all the performance shares and performance units previously granted 
          to him during each performance period.

     (e)  Valuation of Awards.  If a Participant is eligible for treatment 
          under this paragraph 27, his Awards shall be valued and cashed out 
          in  accordance with the provisions of paragraph 26(d) hereof.

     (f)  Payment of Awards.  If a Participant is eligible for treatment 
          under this paragraph 27, he shall be paid, in a single lump-sum 
          cash payment, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 90 
          days after the date of his termination of employment, all of his 
          outstanding Units of Common Stock, Freestanding SARs, stock options 
          (including incentive stock options), performance units (including 
          those earned as a result of the application of paragraph 27(d) 
          above), and performance shares (including those earned as a result 
          of paragraph 27(d) above), and all of his other outstanding Awards, 
          including those granted by the Committee pursuant to its authority 
          under paragraph 3(h) hereof.

     (g)  Deferred Awards.  If a Participant is eligible for treatment under 
          this paragraph 27, all of his deferred Awards for which he has not 
          received payment as of the date of his termination of employment 
          shall be paid to him in a single lump-sum cash payment as soon as 
          practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the date of 
          his termination. For purposes of making such payment, the value of 
          all Awards which are stock based shall be determined by the Change 
          In Control Price.

     (h)  Section 16 of Exchange Act.  Notwithstanding anything contained in 
          this paragraph 27 to the contrary, any Participant who, on the date 
          of his termination of employment under the conditions described in 
          subparagraph (a) above, holds any stock options or Freestanding 
          SARs that have not been outstanding for a period of at least six 
          months from their date of grant and who on the date of such 
          termination is required to report under Section 16 of the Exchange 
          Act shall not be paid such Award until the first day next following 
          the end of such six-month period.

     (i)  Miscellaneous.  Upon a Change In Control, (i) the provisions of 
          paragraphs 16, 20 and 21 hereof shall become null and void and of 
          no force and effect insofar as they apply to a Participant who has 
          been terminated under the conditions described in (a) above; and 
          (ii) no action, including, but not by way of limitation, the 
          amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan, shall be taken 
          which would affect the rights of any Participant or the operation 
          of the Plan with respect to any Award to which the Participant may 
          have become entitled hereunder on or prior to the date of the 
          Change In Control or to which he may become entitled as a result of 
          such Change In Control.

     (j)  Legal Fees.  The Company shall pay all legal fees and related 
          expenses incurred by a Participant in seeking to obtain or enforce 
          any payment, benefit or right he may be entitled to under the Plan 
          after a Change In Control; provided, however, the Participant shall 
          be required to repay any such amounts to the Company to the extent 
          a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final and non-appealable 
          order setting forth the determination that the position taken by 
          the Participant was frivolous or advanced in bad faith.


28.  No Right, Title, or Interest in Company Assets

No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder as a result of 
participation in the Plan until the date of issuance of a stock certificate 
in his name, and, in the case of restricted shares of Common Stock, such 
rights are granted to the Participant under paragraph 10(c) hereof.  To the 
extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under 
this Plan, such rights shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured 
creditor of the Company.


29.  Gender

Throughout this Plan, the masculine gender shall include the feminine.

provided they are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.  For purposes

6.2  Determination of Maximum Award

     (a)  Purpose of Maximum Award.  The Maximum Award for a Performance 
          Period is an addend in the calculation of the Maximum Award Pool 
          for such Performance Period.

     (b)  Calculation of Maximum Award.  The Maximum Award for a Performance 
          Period is the dollar amount obtained by applying the Performance 
          Formula for such Performance Period against the Performance Goals 
          for the same Performance Period.

6.3  Determination of Maximum Award Pool

     (a)  Purpose of Maximum Award Pool.  The Maximum Award Pool, for a 
          Performance Period, serves as the basis for calculating the maximum 
          amount of Awards that may be granted to all Participants for such 
          Performance Period.

     (b)  Calculation of Maximum Award Pool.  The Maximum Award Pool for a 
          Performance Period shall be calculated by adding the Maximum Award 
          for such Performance Period with the Carryforward Amount.

     (c)  Limitation.  The total of all Awards granted for a Performance 
          Period shall not exceed the amount of the Maximum Award Pool for 
          such Performance Period.

     (d)  Allocation of Maximum Award Pool to Covered Employees.  Within the 
          first 90 days of a Performance Period (or, if longer, within the 
          maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code), the 
          Committee shall allocate in writing, or establish in writing an 
          objective means of allocating, on behalf of each Covered Person, a 
          portion of the Maximum Award Pool (not to exceed the amount set 
          forth in Section 6.5(a)) to be granted for such Performance Period 
          in the event the Performance Goals for such period are attained.

     (e)  Negative Discretion.  The Committee is authorized at any time 
          during or after a Performance Period, in its sole and absolute 
          discretion, to reduce or eliminate the Maximum Award Pool for the 
          Performance Period, for any reason, based on such factors, indicia, 
          standards, goals, and/or measures it determines in the exercise of 
          its sole discretion.  Similarly, the Committee is authorized at any 
          time during or after a Performance Period, in its sole and absolute 
          discretion, to reduce or eliminate the portion of the Maximum Award 
          Pool allocated to any Covered Employee for the Performance Period, 
          for any reason.
 
6.4  Determination of Actual Award Pool

     (a)  Purpose of Actual Award Pool.  The Actual Award Pool for a 
          Performance Period determines the aggregate amount of all the 
          Awards that are to be issued under the Plan for such Performance 
          Period.

     (b)  Establishment of Actual Award Pool.  The Actual Award Pool for a 
          Performance Period shall be the Maximum Award Pool for such period 
          after adjustment, if any, by the Committee through Negative 
          Discretion.  Thus, to the extent the Committee elects for a 
          Performance Period not to exercise Negative Discretion with respect 
          to the Maximum Award Pool, the Actual Award Pool for the 
          Performance Period shall be the Maximum Award Pool for such period.

     (c)  Allocation of Actual Award Pool to Individual Participants.  The 
          portion of the Actual Award Pool that will be awarded to any 
          individual Participant will be determined by the Committee, in its 
          sole and absolute discretion, based on such factors, indicia, 
          standards, goals, and measures which it determines in the exercise 
          of its sole discretion.  By way of illustration, and not by way of 
          limitation, the Committee may, but shall not be required to, 
          consider: (1) the Participant's position and level of 
          responsibility, individual merit, contribution to the success of 
          the Company and Target Award; (2) the performance of the Company or 
          the organizational unit of the Participant based upon attainment of 
          financial and other performance criteria and goals; and (3) 
          business unit, division or department achievements.

     (d)  Adjustment to Carryforward Amount.  To the extent the sum of all 
          Awards paid for a Performance Period exceeds the Maximum Award for 
          such period, the Carryforward Amount shall be reduced by an amount 
          equal to such difference.

6.5  Limitations on Awards to Covered Employees

The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall control over any Plan provision to 
the contrary.

     (a)  Maximum Award Payable to Covered Employees.  The maximum Award 
          payable to any Covered Employee under the Plan for a Performance 
          Period shall be $4,000,000.

     (b)  Attainment of Performance Goals.  The Performance Goals for a 
          Performance Period must be achieved in order for a Covered Employee 
          to receive an Award for such Performance Period.

     (c)  Allocation of Actual Award Pool.  The portion of the Actual Award 
          Pool allocated to a Covered Employee by the Committee pursuant to 
          Section 6.4(c) shall not exceed the portion of the Maximum Award 
          Pool allocated to such Covered Employee under Section 6.3(d).


ARTICLE 7  --  PAYMENT OF AWARDS FOR A PERFORMANCE PERIOD

7.1  Certification

     (a)  In General.  Following the completion of each Performance Period, 
          the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, 
          and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance 
          Period have been achieved.  

     (b)  Performance Goals Achieved.  If the Committee certifies that the 
          Performance Goals have been achieved, it shall, based upon 
          application of the Performance Formula to the Performance Goals for 
          such period, calculate and certify in writing the amount of: (i) 
          the Maximum Award; (ii) the Maximum Award Pool; and (iii) the 
          Maximum Award Pool to be allocated to each Covered Employee in 
          accordance with Section 6.3(d).  Upon completion of these written 
          certifications, the Committee shall determine the amount of the 
          Actual Award Pool for the Performance Period.

     (c)  Performance Goals Not Achieved.  In the event the Performance Goals 
          for a Performance Period are not achieved, the limitation contained 
          in Section 6.5(b) shall apply to the Covered Employees.  Further, 
          any Awards granted for the Performance Period must be paid from the 
          Carryforward Amount which shall be reduced to reflect the amount of 
          such Awards.
<PAGE>

7.2  Election of Form of Award

Prior to or coincident with its calculation of the amount of the Actual Award 
Pool for a Performance Period, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, 
determine the form(s) in which to grant Awards under the Plan for such 
period.

7.3  Timing of Award Payments 

Unless deferred pursuant to Article 8 hereof, the Awards granted for a 
Performance Period shall be paid to Participants on the Award Payment Date 
for such Performance Period, which date shall occur as soon as 
administratively practicable following the completion of the procedure 
described in Section 7.1.


ARTICLE 8  --  DEFERRAL OF AWARDS

At the discretion of the Committee, a Participant may, subject to such terms 
and conditions as the Committee may determine, elect to defer payment of all 
or any part of any Award which the Participant might earn with respect to a 
Performance Period by complying with such procedures as the Committee may 
prescribe.  Any Award, or portion thereof, upon which such an election is 
made shall be deferred into, and subject to the terms, conditions and 
requirements of, the Eastman Kodak Employees' Savings and Investment Plan, 
1982 Eastman Kodak Company Executive Deferred Compensation Plan or such other 
applicable deferred compensation plan of the Company.


ARTICLE 9 --  ADDITIONAL AWARDS

9.1  In General  

In addition to the Awards that are authorized to be granted under Article 6 
and paid under Article 7 for a Performance Period, the Committee may, in its 
sole judgment, from time to time grant Awards under the Plan from the 
Carryforward Amount.

9.2  Eligibility

All Key Employees, other than those who are Covered Employees, are eligible 
to receive the Awards authorized to be granted under this Article 9.

9.3  Form of Awards

Any Award granted by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Article 
9 shall be issued in one or more of the forms permitted under Article 5 of 
the Plan.

9.4  Terms and Conditions

The Committee shall, by way of an award notice or otherwise, establish the 
terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations that will apply to an 
Award issued pursuant to this Article 9; provided, however, such terms, 
conditions, restrictions and limitations are not inconsistent with the terms 
of the Plan.

9.5  Carryforward Amount

Upon the issuance of any Award under this Article 9, the Carryforward Amount 
shall be immediately reduced by an amount equal to the value of such Award.

ARTICLE 10  --  CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP

10.1 Background

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan, including, but not 
limited to, Sections 1.1, 4.4 and 13.10, the provisions of this Article 10 
shall control over any contrary provision.  Upon a Change in Ownership: (a) 
the terms of this Article 10 shall immediately become operative, without 
further action or consent by any person or entity; (b) all terms, conditions, 
restrictions and limitations in effect on any unpaid and/or deferred Award 
shall immediately lapse as of the date of such event; (c) no other terms, 
conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations shall be imposed upon any Awards 
on or after such date, and in no event shall an Award be forfeited on or 
after such date; and (d) except where a prorated Award is required to be paid 
under this Article 10, all unvested and/or unpaid Awards or any other 
outstanding Awards shall automatically become one hundred percent (100%) 
vested immediately.

10.2 Payment of Awards

Upon a Change in Ownership, any Key Employee, whether or not he or she is 
still employed by the Company, shall be paid, as soon as practicable but in 
no event later than 90 days after the Change in Ownership, the Awards set 
forth in (a) and (b) below:

     (a)  All of the Key Employee's unpaid and/or deferred Awards; and

     (b)  A pro-rata Award for the Performance Period in which the Change in 
          Ownership occurs.  The amount of the pro-rata Award shall be 
          determined by multiplying the Target Award for such Performance 
          Period for Participants in the same wage grade as the Key Employee 
          by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of full 
          months in the Performance Period prior to the date of the Change in 
          Ownership and the denominator of which shall be the total number of 
          full months in the Performance Period.  For purposes of this 
          calculation, a partial month shall be treated as a full month to 
          the extent of 15 or more days in such month have elapsed.  To the 
          extent Target Awards have not yet been established for the 
          Performance Period, the Target Awards for the immediately preceding 
          Performance Period shall be used.  The pro-rata Awards shall be 
          paid to the Key Employee in the form of a lump-sum cash payment.

10.3 Miscellaneous

Upon a Change In Ownership, no action, including, but not by way of 
limitation, the amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan, shall be 
taken which would affect the rights of any Key Employee or the operation of 
the Plan with respect to any Award to which the Key Employee may have become 
entitled hereunder on or prior to the date of such action or as a result of 
such Change In Ownership.  


ARTICLE 11  --  CHANGE IN CONTROL

11.1 Background

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan, including, but not 
limited to, Sections 1.1, 4.4 and 13.10, the provisions of this Article 11 
shall control over any contrary provision.  All Key Employees shall be 
eligible for the treatment afforded by this Article 11 if their employment 
with the Company terminates within two years following a Change In Control, 
unless the termination is due to (a) death; (b) Disability; (c) Cause; (d) 
resignation other than (1) resignation from a declined reassignment to a job 
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 103

that is not reasonably equivalent in responsibility or compensation (as 
defined in Kodak's Termination Allowance Plan), or that is not in the same 
geographic area (as defined in Kodak's Termination Allowance Plan), or (2) 
resignation within thirty days of a reduction in base pay; or (e) Retirement.

11.2 Vesting and Lapse of Restrictions

If a Key Employee qualifies for treatment under Section 11.1, his or her 
Awards shall be treated in the manner described in Subsections 10.1(b) and 
(c).  Further, except where a prorated Award is required to be paid under 
this Article 11, all of the Key Employee's unvested and/or unpaid Awards 
shall automatically become one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately.

11.3 Payment of Awards

If a Key Employee qualifies for treatment under Section 11.1, he or she shall 
be paid, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 90 days after his 
or her termination of employment, the Awards set forth in (a) and (b) below:

     (a)  All of the Key Employee's unpaid and/or deferred Awards; and

     (b)  A pro-rata Award for the Performance Period in which his or her 
          termination of employment occurs.  The amount of the pro-rata Award 
          shall be determined by multiplying the Target Award for such 
          Performance Period for Participants in the same wage grade as the 
          Key Employee by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the 
          number of full months in the Performance Period prior to the date 
          of the Key Employee's termination of employment and the denominator 
          of which shall be the total number of full months in the 
          Performance Period.  For purposes of this calculation, a partial 
          month shall be treated as a full month to the extent 15 or more 
          days in such month have elapsed.  To the extent Target Awards have 
          not yet been established for the Performance Period, the Target 
          Awards for the immediately preceding Performance Period shall be 
          used.  The pro-rata Awards shall be paid to the Key Employee in the 
          form of a lump-sum cash payment.

11.4 Miscellaneous

Upon a Change In Control, no action, including, but not by way of limitation, 
the amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan, shall be taken which 
would affect the rights of any Key Employee or the operation of the Plan with 
respect to any Award to which the Key Employee may have become entitled 
hereunder prior to the date of the Change In Control or to which he or she 
may become entitled as a result of such Change In Control.


ARTICLE 12  --  SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

12.1 Available Shares

Subject to adjustment as provided in Subsection 12.2 below, the maximum 
number of shares of Common Stock, $2.50 par value per share, of the Company 
which shall be available for grant of Awards under the Plan during its term 
shall not exceed 1,000,000.  Any shares of Common Stock related to Awards 
which terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without 
the issuance of such shares, are settled in cash in lieu of Common Stock, or 
are exchanged with the Committee's permission for Awards not involving Common 
Stock, shall not be available again for grant under the Plan.  The shares of 
Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan may be authorized and 
unissued shares or treasury shares.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 104

12.2 Adjustment of Shares Available

     (a)  In General.  The provisions of this Subsection 12.2(a) are subject 
          to the limitation contained in Subsection 12.2(b).  If there is any 
          change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock through 
          the declaration of stock dividends, stock splits or the like, the 
          number of shares available for Awards and the shares subject to any 
          Award shall be automatically adjusted.  If there is any change in 
          the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock through any change 
          in the capital account of Kodak, or through a merger, 
          consolidation, separation (including a spin off or other 
          distribution of stock or property) reorganization (whether or not 
          such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in 
          Section 368(a) of the Code) or partial or complete liquidation, the 
          Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the maximum number 
          of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan and 
          any adjustments and/or modifications to outstanding Awards as it, 
          in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.  In the event of any 
          other change in the capital structure or in the Common Stock of the 
          Company, the Committee shall also be authorized to make such 
          appropriate adjustments in the maximum number of shares of Common 
          Stock available for issuance under the Plan and any adjustments 
          and/or modifications to outstanding Awards as it, in its sole 
          discretion, deems appropriate.

     (b)  Covered Employees.  In no event shall the Award of any Participant 
          who is a Covered Employee be adjusted pursuant to Subsection 
          12.2(a) to the extent it would cause such Award to fail to qualify 
          as "Performance-Based Compensation" under Section 162(m) of the 
          Code.


ARTICLE 13  --  MISCELLANEOUS

13.1 Nonassignability

No Awards under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation, 
anticipation, sale, transfer (except by will or the laws of descent and 
distribution), assignment, pledge, or encumbrance, nor shall any Award be 
payable to anyone other than the Participant to whom it was granted.

13.2 Withholding Taxes

The Company shall be entitled to deduct from any payment under the Plan, 
regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income 
and employment taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such 
payment or may require the Participant to pay to it such tax prior to and as 
a condition of the making of such payment.  In accordance with any applicable 
administrative guidelines it establishes, the Committee may allow a 
Participant to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld from an 
Award by withholding from any payment of Common Stock due as a result of such 
Award, or by permitting the Participant to deliver to the Company, shares of 
Common Stock having a fair market value, as determined by the Committee, 
equal to the amount of such required withholding taxes.

13.3 Amendments to Awards

The Committee may at any time unilaterally amend any unearned, deferred or 
unpaid Award, including, but not by way of limitation, Awards earned but not 
yet paid, to the extent it deems appropriate; provided, however, that any 
such amendment which, in the opinion of the Committee, is adverse to the 
Participant shall require the Participant's consent.
<PAGE>

13.4 Regulatory Approvals and Listings

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Company 
shall have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates of Common Stock 
evidencing Awards or any other Award resulting in the payment of Common Stock 
prior to (a) the obtaining of any approval from any governmental agency which 
the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or 
advisable, (b) the admission of such shares to listing on the stock exchange 
on which the Common Stock may be listed, and (c) the completion of any 
registration or other qualification of said shares under any state or Federal 
law or ruling of any governmental body which the Company shall, in its sole 
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.

13.5 No Right to Continued Employment or Grants

Participation in the Plan shall not give any Key Employee any right to remain 
in the employ of the Company.  Kodak or, in the case of employment with a 
Subsidiary, the Subsidiary, reserves the right to terminate any Key Employee 
at any time.  Further, the adoption of this Plan shall not be deemed to give 
any Key Employee or any other individual any right to be selected as a 
Participant or to be granted an Award.

13.6 Amendment/Termination

The Committee may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time with or without 
prior notice.  In addition, the Committee may, from time to time and with or 
without prior notice, amend the Plan in any manner, but may not without 
shareholder approval adopt any amendment which would require the vote of the 
shareholders of Kodak pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code, but only 
insofar as such amendment affects Covered Employees. 

13.7 Governing Law

The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of New York, except as superseded by applicable Federal Law.

13.8 No Right, Title, or Interest in Company Assets

No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder as a result of 
participation in the Plan until the date of issuance of a stock certificate 
in his or her name, and, in the case of restricted shares of Common Stock, 
such rights are granted to the Participant under the Plan.  To the extent any 
person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under this Plan, 
such rights shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured creditor of 
the Company and the Participant shall not have any rights in or against any 
specific assets of the Company.  All of the Awards granted under the Plan 
shall be unfunded.

13.9 No Guarantee of Tax Consequences

No person connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited 
to, Kodak and its Subsidiaries and their directors, officers, agents and 
employees makes any representation, commitment, or guarantee that any tax 
treatment, including, but not limited to, Federal, state and local income, 
estate and gift tax treatment, will be applicable with respect to amounts 
deferred under the Plan, or paid to or for the benefit of a Participant under 
the Plan, or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a 
Participant on account of participation in the Plan.

13.10 Compliance with Section 162(m)

If any provision of the Plan would cause the Awards granted to a Covered 
Person not to constitute qualified Performance-Based Compensation under 
Section 162(m) of the Code, that provision, insofar as it pertains to the 
Covered Person, shall be severed from, and shall be deemed not to be a part 
of, this Plan, but the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and 
effect.

Performance Cycles commencing prior to such date.

     Performance Shares

provide the Committee the ability to qualify the Stock Awards authorized

shares under Article 12 as "Performance-Based Compensation" under Section 
162(m) of the Code.  The provisions of this Article 7 shall control over any 
contrary provision contained in Articles 10, 11 or 12.

Committee will, in its sole discretion, designate within the first 90 days of 
a Performance Period (or, if longer, within the maximum period allowed under 
Section 162(m) of the Code) which Covered Employees will be Participants for 
such period.  However, designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for 
a Performance Period shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to 
receive an Award for the period.  The determination as to whether or not such 
Participant becomes entitled to an Award for such Performance Period shall be 
decided solely in accordance with the provisions of this Article 7.  
Moreover, designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a particular 
Performance Period shall not require designation of such Covered Employee as 
a Participant in any subsequent Performance Period and designation of one 
Covered Employee as a Participant shall not require designation of any other 
Covered Employee as a Participant in such period or in any other period.

7.3  Discretion of Committee with Respect to Performance Awards

full discretion to select the length of such Performance Period, the type(s)

          Performance Award for a Performance Period only to the extent that: 
          (1) the Performance Goals for such period are achieved; and (2) and 
          the Performance Formula as applied against such Performance Goals 
          determines that all or some portion of such Participant's 
          Performance Award has been earned for the Performance Period.

     (c)  Certification.  Following the completion of a Performance Period, 
          the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, 
          and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance 
          Period have been achieved and, if so, to also calculate and certify 
          in writing the amount of the Performance Awards earned for the 
          period based upon the Performance Formula. The Committee shall then 
          determine the actual size of each Participant's Performance Award 
          for the Performance Period and, in so doing, shall apply Negative 
          Discretion, if and when it deems appropriate.

<PAGE>

     (d)  Negative Discretion.  In determining the actual size of an 
          individual Performance Award for a Performance Period, the 
          Committee may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Performance 
          Award earned under the Performance Formula for the Performance 
          Period through the use of Negative Discretion, if in its sole 
          judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate.

     (e)  Timing of Award Payments.  The Awards granted for a Performance 
          Period shall be paid to Participants as soon as administratively 
          possible following completion of the certifications required by 
          Subsection 7.4(c).

     (f)  Noncompetition.  No Participant shall receive payment for an Award 
          if, subsequent to the commencement of a Performance Period and 
          prior to the date the Awards for such period are paid, the 
          Participant engages in any of the conduct prohibited under Section 
          14.3.

7.5  Maximum Award Payable

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan to the contrary, the 
maximum Performance Award payable to any one Participant under the Plan for a 
Performance Period is 50,000 shares of Common Stock or, in the event the 
Performance Award is paid in cash, the equivalent cash value thereof on the 
Performance Award's Effective Date.


ARTICLE 8  --  STOCK OPTIONS

8.1  In General

Awards may be granted to Employees in the form of stock options.  These stock 
options may be incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of 
the Code or non-qualified stock options (i.e., stock options which are not 
incentive stock options), or a combination of both.  All Awards under the 
Plan issued to Covered Employees in the form of stock options shall qualify 
as "Performance-Based Compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.

8.2  Terms and Conditions of Stock Options  

An option shall be exercisable in whole or in such installments and at such 
times as may be determined by the Committee.  The price at which Common Stock 
may be purchased upon exercise of a stock option shall be not less than 100% 
of the fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined by the Committee, 
on the Effective Date of the option's grant.  Moreover, all options shall not 
expire later than 10 years from the Effective Date of the option's grant.  
Stock options shall not be repriced, i.e., there shall be no grant of a stock 
option(s) to a Participant in exchange for a Participant's agreement to 
cancellation of a higher-priced stock option(s) that was previously granted 
to such Participant.

8.3  Restrictions Relating to Incentive Stock Options  

Stock options issued in the form of incentive stock options shall, in 
addition to being subject to the terms and conditions of Section 8.2, comply 
with Section 422 of the Code.  Accordingly, the aggregate fair market value 
(determined at the time the option was granted) of the Common Stock with 
respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time 
by a Participant during any calendar year (under this Plan or any other plan 
of the Company) shall not exceed $100,000 (or such other limit as may be 
required by the Code).  From the maximum number of shares available for 
issuance under the Plan under Section 6.1, the number of shares of Common 
Stock that shall be available for incentive stock options granted under the 
Plan is 16,000,000.

8.4  Additional Terms and Conditions  

The Committee may, by way of the Award Notice or otherwise, establish such 
other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any 
stock option Award, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan.

8.5  Exercise  

Upon exercise, the option price of a stock option may be paid in cash, shares 
of Common Stock, a combination of the foregoing, or such other consideration 
as the Committee may deem appropriate.  The Committee shall establish 
appropriate methods for accepting Common Stock, whether restricted or 
unrestricted, and may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on the 
use of such Common Stock to exercise a stock option. Subject to Section 19.9, 
stock options awarded under the Plan may be exercised by way of the Company's 
broker-assisted stock option exercise program, provided such program is 
available at the time of the option's exercise.  The Committee may permit a 
Participant to satisfy any amounts required to be withheld under applicable 
Federal, state and local tax laws, in effect from time to time, by electing 
to have the Company withhold a portion of the shares of Common Stock to be 
delivered for the payment of such taxes.

8.6  Maximum Award Payable

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan to the contrary, the 
maximum number of shares for which stock options may be granted under the 
Plan to any one Participant for a Performance Period is 200,000 shares of 
Common Stock.


ARTICLE 9  --  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

9.1  In General  

Awards may be granted to Employees in the form of stock appreciation rights 
("SARs").  An SAR may be granted in tandem with all or a portion of a related 
stock option under the Plan ("Tandem SARs"), or may be granted separately 
("Freestanding SARs").  A Tandem SAR may be granted either at the time of the 
grant of the related stock option or at any time thereafter during the term 
of the stock option.  SARs shall entitle the recipient to receive a payment 
equal to the appreciation in market value of a stated number of shares of 
Common Stock from the exercise price to the market value on the date of 
exercise.  All Awards under the Plan issued to Covered Employees in the form 
of an SAR shall qualify as "Performance-Based Compensation" under Section 
162(m) of the Code.

9.2  Terms and Conditions of Tandem SARs  

A Tandem SAR shall be exercisable to the extent, and only to the extent, that 
the related stock option is exercisable, and the "exercise price" of such an 
SAR (the base from which the value of the SAR is measured at its exercise) 
shall be the option price under the related stock option.  However, at no 
time shall a Tandem SAR be issued if the option price of its related stock 
option is less than the fair market value of the Common Stock, as determined 
by the Committee, on the Effective Date of the Tandem SAR's grant.  If a 
related stock option is exercised as to some or all of the shares covered by 
the Award, the related Tandem SAR, if any, shall be canceled automatically to 
the extent of the number of shares covered by the stock option exercise.  
Upon exercise of a Tandem SAR as to some or all of the shares covered by the 
Award, the related stock option shall be canceled automatically to the extent 
of the number of shares covered by such exercise, and such shares shall not 
again be eligible for grant in accordance with Section 6.1.  Moreover, all 
Tandem SARs shall not expire later than 10 years from the Effective Date of 
the SAR's grant.
<PAGE>

9.3  Terms and Conditions of Freestanding SARs  

Freestanding SARs shall be exercisable in whole or in such installments and 
at such times as may be determined by the Committee.  The exercise price of a 
Freestanding SAR shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of the 
Common Stock, as determined by the Committee, on the Effective Date of the 
Freestanding SAR's grant. Moreover, all Freestanding SARs shall not expire 
later than 10 years from the Effective Date of the Freestanding SAR's grant.

9.4  Deemed Exercise  

The Committee may provide that an SAR shall be deemed to be exercised at the 
close of business on the scheduled expiration date of such SAR if at such 
time the SAR by its terms remains exercisable and, if so exercised, would 
result in a payment to the holder of such SAR.

9.5  Additional Terms and Conditions  

The Committee may, by way of the Award Notice or otherwise, determine such 
other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any SAR 
Award, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan.

9.6  Maximum Award Payable

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan to the contrary, the 
maximum number of shares for which SARs may be granted under the Plan to any 
one Participant for a Performance Period is 200,000 shares of Common Stock.


ARTICLE 10  --  STOCK AWARDS

10.1 Grants  

Awards may be granted in the form of Stock Awards.  Stock Awards shall be 
awarded in such numbers and at such times during the term of the Plan as the 
Committee shall determine.

10.2 Award Restrictions  

Stock Awards shall be subject to such terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or 
limitations, if any, as the Committee deems appropriate including, but not by 
way of limitation, restrictions on transferability and continued employment; 
provided, however, they are not inconsistent with the Plan.  The Committee 
may modify or accelerate the delivery of a Stock Award under such 
circumstances as it deems appropriate.

10.3 Rights as Shareholders  

During the period in which any restricted shares of Common Stock are subject 
to the restrictions imposed under Section 10.2, the Committee may, in its 
sole discretion, grant to the Participant to whom such restricted shares have 
been awarded all or any of the rights of a shareholder with respect to such 
shares, including, but not by way of limitation, the right to vote such 
shares and, pursuant to Article 15, the right to receive dividends.

10.4 Evidence of Award  

Any Stock Award granted under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the 
Committee deems appropriate, including, without limitation, book-entry 
registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates.
<PAGE>

ARTICLE 11  --  PERFORMANCE UNITS

11.1 Grants  

Awards may be granted in the form of performance units.  Performance units, 
as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer to Units valued by reference 
to designated criteria established by the Committee, other than Common Stock.

11.2 Performance Criteria  

Performance units shall be contingent on the attainment during a performance 
period of certain performance objectives.  The length of the performance 
period, the performance objectives to be achieved during the performance 
period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such objectives have 
been attained shall be conclusively determined by the Committee in the 
exercise of its absolute discretion.  Performance objectives may be revised 
by the Committee, at such times as it deems appropriate during the 
performance period, in order to take into consideration any unforeseen events 
or changes in circumstances.

11.3 Additional Terms and Conditions  

The Committee may, by way of the Award Notice or otherwise, determine such 
other terms, conditions, restrictions, and/or limitations, if any, of any 
Award of performance units, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan.


ARTICLE 12  --  PERFORMANCE SHARES

12.1 Grants  

Awards may be granted in the form of performance shares.  Performance shares, 
as that term is used in this Plan, shall refer to shares of Common Stock or 
Units which are expressed in terms of Common Stock.

12.2 Performance Criteria  

Performance shares shall be contingent upon the attainment during a 
performance period of certain performance objectives.  The length of the 
performance period, the performance objectives to be achieved during the 
performance period, and the measure of whether and to what degree such 
objectives have been attained shall be conclusively determined by the 
Committee in the exercise of its absolute discretion.  Performance objectives 
may be revised by the Committee, at such times as it deems appropriate during 
the performance period, in order to take into consideration any unforeseen 
events or changes in circumstances.

12.3 Additional Terms and Conditions  

The Committee may, by way of the Award Notice or otherwise, determine such 
other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any 
Award of performance shares, provided they are not inconsistent with the 
Plan.


ARTICLE 13  --  PERFORMANCE STOCK PROGRAM

13.1 Purpose

The purposes of the Performance Stock Program are: (a) to promote the 
interests of the Company and its shareholders by providing a means to acquire 
a proprietary interest in the Company to selected Key Employees who are in a 
position to make a substantial contribution to the continued progress and 
success of the Company; (b) to attract and retain qualified individuals to 
serve as Employees in those positions; (c) to enhance long-term performance 
of the Company by linking a meaningful portion of the compensation of 
selected Key Employees to the achievement of specific long-term financial 
objectives of the Company; and (d) to motivate and reward selected Key 
Employees to undertake actions to increase the price of the Common Stock.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 120

13.2 Eligibility

Any Key Employee is eligible to participate in the Performance Stock Program.  
Within the first 90 days of a Performance Cycle (or, if longer, within the 
maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code), the CEO will 
recommend to the Committee, and from such recommendations the Committee will 
select, those Key Employees who will be Participants for such Performance 
Cycle.  However, designation of a Key Employee as a Participant for a 
Performance Cycle shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to receive 
payment of an Award for the cycle.  The determination as to whether or not 
such Participant becomes entitled to payment of an Award for such Performance 
Cycle shall be decided solely in accordance with the provisions of this 
Article 13.  Moreover, designation of a Key Employee as a Participant for a 
particular Performance Cycle shall not require designation of such Key 
Employee as a Participant in any subsequent Performance Cycle and designation 
of one Key Employee as a Participant shall not require designation of any 
other Key Employee as a Participant in such Performance Cycle or in any other 
Performance Cycle.

13.3 Description of Awards

Awards granted under the Performance Stock Program provide Participants with 
the opportunity to earn shares of Common Stock, subject to the terms and 
conditions of Section 13.8 below.  Each Award granted under the Plan for a 
Performance Cycle shall consist of a Target Award expressed as fixed number 
of shares of Common Stock.  In the event the Performance Goals for the 
Performance Cycle are achieved, the Performance Formula shall determine, with 
regards to a particular Participant, what percentage of the Participant's 
Target Award for the Performance Cycle will be earned.  All of the Awards 
issued under the Performance Stock Program to Covered Employees are intended 
to qualify as "Performance-Based Compensation" under Section 162(m) of the 
Code.
 
13.4 Procedure for Determining Awards

Within the first 90 days of a Performance Cycle (or, if longer, within the 
maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code), the Committee shall 
establish in writing for such Performance Cycle the following: the specific 
Performance Criteria that will be used to establish the Performance Goal(s), 
the kind(s) and/or level(s) of the Performance Goal(s), whether the 
Performance Goal(s) is(are) to apply to the Company, Kodak, a Subsidiary, or 
any one or more subunits of the foregoing, the amount of the Target Awards, 
and the Performance Formula.

13.5 Payment of Awards
     (a)  Condition to Receipt of Awards.  Except as provided in Section 
          13.7, a Participant must be employed by the Company on the 
          Performance Cycle's Award Payment Date to be eligible for an Award 
          for such Performance Cycle.

     (b)  Limitation.  A Participant shall be eligible to receive an Award 
          for a Performance Cycle only if: (1) the Performance Goals for such 
          cycle are achieved; and (2) the Performance Formula as applied 
          against such Performance Goals determines that all or some portion 
          of the Participant's Target Award has been earned for the 
          Performance Period.

     (c)  Certification.  Following the completion of a Performance Cycle, 
          the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, 
          and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance Cycle 
          have been achieved.  If the Committee certifies that the 
          Performance Goals have been achieved, it shall, based upon 
          application of the Performance Formula to the Performance Goals for 
          such cycle, also calculate and certify in writing for each 
          Participant what percentage of the Participant's Target Award has 
          been earned for the cycle.  The Committee shall then determine the 
          actual size of each Participant's Award for the Performance Cycle 
          and, in so doing, shall apply Negative Discretion, if and when it 
          deems appropriate.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 121

     (d)  Negative Discretion.  In determining the actual size of an 
          individual Award to be paid for a Performance Cycle, the Committee 
          may, through the use of Negative Discretion, reduce or eliminate 
          the amount of the Award earned under the Performance Formula for 
          the Performance Cycle, if in its sole judgment, such reduction or 
          elimination is appropriate.

     (e)  Timing of Award Payments.  The Awards granted by the Committee for 
          a Performance Cycle shall be paid to Participants on the Award 
          Payment Date for such Performance Cycle.

     (f)  New Participants.  Participants who are employed by the Company 
          after the Committee's selection of Participants for the Performance 
          Cycle, as well as Key Employees who are selected by the Committee 
          to be Participants after such date, shall, in the event Awards are 
          paid for the Performance Cycle, only be entitled to a pro-rata 
          Award.  The amount of the pro-rata Award shall be determined by 
          multiplying the Award the Participant would have otherwise been 
          paid if he or she had been a Participant for the entire Performance 
          Cycle by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of full 
          months he or she was eligible to participate in the Performance 
          Stock Program during the Performance Cycle over the total number of 
          full months in the Performance Cycle.  For purposes of this 
          calculation, a partial month of participation shall: (1) be treated 
          as a full month of participation to the extent a Participant 
          participates in the Performance Stock Program on 15 or more days of 
          such month; and (2) not be taken into consideration to the extent 
          the Participant participates in the Performance Stock Program for 
          less than 15 days of such month.

     (g)  Noncompetition.  No Participant shall receive payment for an Award 
          if, subsequent to the commencement of the Performance Cycle and 
          prior to the Award Payment Date for such cycle, the Participant 
          engages in the conduct prohibited under Section 14.3.

13.6 Maximum Award Payable

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan to the contrary, the 
maximum Award payable to any one Participant under the Plan for a Performance 
Cycle is 50,000 shares of Common Stock.

13.7 Termination of Employment During Performance Cycle

In the event a Participant terminates employment due to death, Disability, 
Retirement or termination of employment for an Approved Reason prior to the 
Award Payment Date for a Performance Cycle, the Participant shall receive, if 
Awards are paid for such Performance Cycle and if he or she complies with the 
requirements of Subsection 13.5(g) through the Award Payment Date, a pro-rata 
Award.  The amount of the pro-rata Award shall be determined by multiplying 
the Award the Participant would have otherwise been paid if he or she had 
been a Participant through the Award Payment Date for the Performance Cycle 
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months he or she 
was a Participant during such Performance Cycle over the total number of full 
months in the Performance Cycle.  For purposes of this calculation, a partial 
month of participation shall: (1) be treated as a full month of participation 
to the extent a Participant participates in the Performance Stock Program on 
15 or more days of such month; and (2) not be taken into consideration to the 
extent the Participant participates in the Performance Stock Program for less 
than 15 days of such month.  Such pro-rata Award shall be paid in the form of 
shares of Common Stock, not subject to any restrictions, limitations or 
escrow requirements.  In the event of Disability, Retirement or termination 
for an Approved Reason, the pro-rata Award shall be paid directly to the 
Participant and, in the event of death, to the Participant's estate.

13.8 Awards

On the Award Payment Date for a Performance Cycle, the Committee shall issue 
to each Participant the Award, in the form of shares of Common Stock, he or 
she has earned for such Performance Cycle.  Such shares of Common Stock shall 
be subject to such terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as the 
Committee, in its sole judgment, determines.


ARTICLE 14  --  PAYMENT OF AWARDS

14.1 In General

Absent a Plan provision to the contrary, payment of Awards may, at the 
discretion of the Committee, be made in cash, Common Stock, a combination of 
cash and Common Stock, or any other form of property as the Committee shall 
determine.  In addition, payment of Awards may include such terms, 
conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as the Committee deems 
appropriate, including, in the case of Awards paid in the form of Common 
Stock, restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provisions; provided, however, 
such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations are not inconsistent 
with the Plan.  Further, payment of Awards may be made in the form of a lump 
sum or installments, as determined by the Committee.

14.2 Termination of Employment

If a Participant's employment with the Company terminates for a reason other 
than death, Disability, Retirement, or any Approved Reason, all unexercised, 
unearned, and/or unpaid Awards, including, but not by way of limitation, 
Awards earned but not yet paid, all unpaid dividends and dividend 
equivalents, and all interest accrued on the foregoing shall be canceled or 
forfeited, as the case may be, unless the Participant's Award Notice provides 
otherwise.  The Committee shall, notwithstanding Sections 4.4 and 19.11 to 
the contrary, have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations to 
determine the treatment of an Award under the Plan in the event of the 
Participant's death, Disability, Retirement or termination for an Approved 
Reason, provided, however, in the case of Awards issued under the Restricted 
Stock Program, such rules and regulations are consistent with Section 13.7.

14.3 Noncompetition

Unless the Award Notice specifies otherwise, a Participant shall forfeit all 
unexercised, unearned, and/or unpaid Awards, including, but not by way of 
limitation, Awards earned but not yet paid, all unpaid dividends and dividend 
equivalents, and all interest, if any, accrued on the foregoing if, (i) in 
the opinion of the Committee, the Participant, without the prior written 
consent of Kodak, engages directly or indirectly in any manner or capacity as 
principal, agent, partner, officer, director, stockholder, employee, or 
otherwise, in any business or activity competitive with the business 
conducted by Kodak or any Subsidiary; (ii) at any time divulges to any person 
or any entity other than the Company any trade secrets, methods, processes or 
the proprietary or confidential information of the Company; or (iii) the 
Participant performs any act or engages in any activity which in the opinion 
of the CEO is inimical to the best interests of the Company.  For purposes of 
this Section 14.3, a Participant shall not be deemed a stockholder if the 
Participant's record and beneficial ownership amount to not more than 1% of 
the outstanding capital stock of any company subject to the periodic and 
other reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
<PAGE>

ARTICLE 15  --  DIVIDEND AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

If an Award is granted in the form of a Stock Award, stock option, or 
performance share, or in the form of any other stock-based grant, the 
Committee may choose, at the time of the grant of the Award or any time 
thereafter up to the time of the Award's payment, to include as part of such 
Award an entitlement to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, subject to 
such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as the 
Committee may establish.  Dividends and dividend equivalents shall be paid in 
such form and manner (i.e., lump sum or installments), and at such time(s) as 
the Committee shall determine.  All dividends or dividend equivalents which 
are not paid currently may, at the Committee's discretion, accrue interest, 
be reinvested into additional shares of Common Stock or, in the case of 
dividends or dividend equivalents credited in connection with performance 
shares, be credited as additional performance shares and paid to the 
Participant if and when, and to the extent that, payment is made pursuant to 
such Award.  The total number of shares available for grant under Section 6.1 
shall not be reduced to reflect any dividends or dividend equivalents that 
are reinvested into additional shares of Common Stock or credited as 
additional performance shares.


ARTICLE 16  --  DEFERRAL OF AWARDS

At the discretion of the Committee, payment of any Award, dividend, or 
dividend equivalent, or any portion thereof, may be deferred by a Participant 
until such time as the Committee may establish.  All such deferrals shall be 
accomplished by the delivery of a written, irrevocable election by the 
Participant prior to the time established by the Committee for such purpose, 
on a form provided by the Company.  Further, all deferrals shall be made in 
accordance with administrative guidelines established by the Committee to 
ensure that such deferrals comply with all applicable requirements of the 
Code.  Deferred payments shall be paid in a lump sum or installments, as 
determined by the Committee.  Deferred Awards may also be credited with 
interest, at such rates to be determined by the Committee, and, with respect 
to those deferred Awards denominated in the form of Common Stock, with 
dividends or dividend equivalents.


ARTICLE 17  --  CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP

17.1 Background  

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan, including, but not 
limited to, Sections 4.4 and 19.11, the provisions of this Article 17 shall 
control over any contrary provision.  Upon a Change In Ownership: (i) the 
terms of this Article 17 shall immediately become operative, without further 
action or consent by any person or entity; (ii) all terms, conditions, 
restrictions, and limitations in effect on any unexercised, unearned, unpaid, 
and/or deferred Award, or any other outstanding Award, shall immediately 
lapse as of the date of such event; (iii) no other terms, conditions, 
restrictions and/or limitations shall be imposed upon any Awards on or after 
such date, and in no circumstance shall an Award be forfeited on or after 
such date; and (iv) except in those instances where a prorated Awards is 
required to be paid under this Article 17, all unexercised, unvested, 
unearned, and/or unpaid Awards or any other outstanding Awards shall 
automatically become one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately.

17.2 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents  

Upon a Change In Ownership, all unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents and 
all interest accrued thereon, if any, shall be treated and paid under this 
Article 17 in the identical manner and time as the Award under which such 
dividends or dividend equivalents have been credited.  For example, if upon a 
Change In Ownership, an Award under this Article 17 is to be paid in a 
prorated fashion, all unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents with respect 
to such Award shall be paid according to the same formula used to determine 
the amount of such prorated Award.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 124

17.3 Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares  

If a Change In Ownership occurs during the term of one or more performance 
periods for which the Committee has granted performance units and/or 
performance shares (including those issued as Performance Awards under 
Article 7), the term of each such performance period (hereinafter a "current 
performance period") shall immediately terminate upon the occurrence of such 
event.  Upon a Change In Ownership, for each "current performance period" and 
each completed performance period for which the Committee has not on or 
before such date made a determination as to whether and to what degree the 
performance objectives for such period have been attained (hereinafter a 
"completed performance period"), it shall be assumed that the performance 
objectives have been attained at a level of one hundred percent (100%) or the 
equivalent thereof.

A Participant in one or more "current performance periods" shall be 
considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive, a prorated 
portion of the Awards previously granted to him for each such performance 
period.  Such prorated portion shall be determined by multiplying the number 
of performance shares or performance units, as the case may be, granted to 
the Participant by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of 
whole months that have elapsed since the beginning of the performance period, 
and the denominator of which is the total number of full months in such 
performance period.  For purposes of this calculation, a partial month shall 
be treated as a full month to the extent 15 or more days in such month have 
elapsed.

A Participant in one or more "completed performance periods" shall be 
considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive all the 
performance shares or performance units, as the case may be, previously 
granted to him during each such performance period.

17.4 Treatment of Awards under Performance Stock Program  

Upon a Change in Ownership, any Participant of the Performance Stock Program, 
whether or not he or she is still employed by the Company, shall be paid, as 
soon as practicable but in no event later than 90 days after the Change in 
Ownership, a pro-rata Award for each Performance Cycle in which Participant 
was selected to participate and during which the Change in Ownership occurs.  
The amount of the pro-rata Award shall be determined by multiplying the 
Target Award for such Performance Cycle for Participants in the same wage 
grade as the Participant by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the 
number of full months in the Performance Cycle prior to the date of the 
Change in Ownership and the denominator of which shall be the total number of 
full months in the Performance Cycle.  For purposes of this calculation, a 
partial month shall be treated as a full month to the extent 15 or more days 
in such month have elapsed.  To the extent Target Awards have not yet been 
established for the Performance Cycle, the Target Awards for the immediately 
preceding Performance Cycle shall be used.

17.5 Valuation of Awards  

Upon a Change In Ownership, all outstanding Units of Common Stock, 
Freestanding SARs, stock options (including incentive stock options), Stock 
Awards (including those issued as Performance Awards under Article 7), 
performance shares (including those earned as a result of the application of 
Section 17.3 above), and all other outstanding stock-based Awards (including 
those earned as a result of the application of Section 17.4 above and those 
granted by the Committee pursuant to its authority under Subsection 4.2(m) 
hereof), shall be valued and cashed out on the basis of the Change In Control 
Price.

17.6 Payment of Awards  

Upon a Change In Ownership, any Participant, whether or not he or she is 
still employed by the Company, shall be paid, in a single lump-sum cash 
payment, as soon as practicable but in no event later than 90 days after the 
Change In Ownership, all of his or her Units of Common Stock, Freestanding 
SARs, stock options (including incentive stock options), Stock Awards 
(including those issued as Performance Awards under Article 7), performance 
units and shares (including those earned as a result of the application of 
Section 17.3 above), all other outstanding stock-based Awards (including 
those earned as a result of the application of Section 17.4 above and those 
granted by the Committee pursuant to its authority under Subsection 4.2(m) 
hereof), and all other outstanding Awards.

17.7 Deferred Awards  

Upon a Change In Ownership, all Awards deferred by a Participant under 
Article 16 hereof, but for which he or she has not received payment as of 
such date, shall be paid in a single lump-sum cash payment as soon as 
practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the Change In 
Ownership.  For purposes of making such payment, the value of all Awards 
which are stock based shall be determined by the Change In Control Price.

17.8 Section 16 of Exchange Act  

     (Intentionally Omitted)

17.9 Miscellaneous  

Upon a Change In Ownership, (i) the provisions of Sections 14.2, 14.3 and 
19.3 hereof shall become null and void and of no further force and effect; 
and (ii) no action, including, but not by way of limitation, the amendment, 
suspension, or termination of the Plan, shall be taken which would affect the 
rights of any Participant or the operation of the Plan with respect to any 
Award to which the Participant may have become entitled hereunder on or prior 
to the date of such action or as a result of such Change In Ownership.


ARTICLE 18  --  CHANGE IN CONTROL

18.1 Background  

Notwithstanding any provision contained in the Plan, including, but not 
limited to, Sections 4.4 and 19.11, the provisions of this Article 18 shall 
control over any contrary provision.  All Participants shall be eligible for 
the treatment afforded by this Article 18 if their employment terminates 
within two years following a Change In Control, unless the termination is due 
to (i) death, (ii) Disability, (iii) Cause, (iv) resignation other than (A) 
resignation from a declined reassignment to a job that is not reasonably 
equivalent in responsibility or compensation (as defined in Kodak's 
Termination Allowance Plan), or that is not in the same geographic area (as 
defined in Kodak's Termination Allowance Plan), or (B) resignation within 30 
days following a reduction in base pay, or (v) Retirement.

18.2 Vesting and Lapse of Restrictions  

If a Participant is eligible for treatment under this Article 18, (i) all of 
the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations in effect on any of his 
or her unexercised, unearned, unpaid and/or deferred Awards shall immediately 
lapse as of the date of his or her termination of employment; (ii) no other 
terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations shall be imposed upon any 
of his or her Awards on or after such date, and in no event shall any of his 
or her Awards be forfeited on or after such date; and (iii) except in those 
instances where a prorated Award is required to be paid under this Article 
18, all of his or her unexercised, unvested, unearned and/or unpaid Awards 
shall automatically become one hundred percent (100%) vested immediately upon 
his or her termination of employment.

18.3 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents  

If a Participant is eligible for treatment under this Article 18, all of his 
or her unpaid dividends and dividend equivalents and all interest accrued 
thereon, if any, shall be treated and paid under this Article 18 in the 
identical manner and time as the Award under which such dividends or dividend 
equivalents have been credited.

18.4 Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares 

If a Participant holding either performance units or performance shares 
(including those issued as Performance Awards under Article 7) is terminated 
under the conditions described in Section 18.1 above, the provisions of this 
Section 18.4 shall determine the manner in which such performance units 
and/or performance shares shall be paid to the Participant.  For purposes of 
making such payment, each "current performance period," as that term is 
defined in Section 17.3, shall be treated as terminating upon the date of the 
Participant's termination of employment, and for each such "current 
performance period" and each "completed performance period," as that term is 
defined in Section 17.3, it shall be assumed that the performance objectives 
have been attained at a level of one hundred percent (100%) or the equivalent 
thereof.  If the Participant is participating in one or more "current 
performance periods," he or she shall be considered to have earned and, 
therefore, be entitled to receive that prorated portion of the Awards 
previously granted to him for each such performance period, as determined in 
accordance with the formula established in Section 17.3 hereof.  A 
Participant in one or more "completed performance periods" shall be 
considered to have earned and, therefore, be entitled to receive all the 
performance shares and performance units previously granted to him during 
each performance period.

18.5 Treatment of Awards under Performance Stock Program

If a Participant of the Performance Stock Program is eligible for treatment 
under this Article 18, he or she shall be paid, as soon as practicable but in 
no event later than 90 days after the date of his or her termination of 
employment, a pro-rata Award for each Performance Cycle in which Participant 
was selected to participate and during which the Change in Ownership occurs.  
The amount of the pro-rata Award shall be determined by multiplying the 
Target Award for such Performance Cycle for Participants in the same wage 
grade as the Participant by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the 
number of full months in the Performance Cycle prior to the date of his or 
her termination of employment and the denominator of which shall be the total 
number of full months in the Performance Cycle.  For purposes of this 
calculation, a partial month shall be treated as a full month to the extent 
15 or more days in such month have elapsed.  To the extent Target Awards have 
not yet been established for the Performance Cycle, the Target Awards for the 
immediately preceding Performance Cycle shall be used.

18.6 Valuation of Awards  

If a Participant is eligible for treatment under this Article 18, his or her 
Awards shall be valued and cashed out in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 17.5.

18.7 Payment of Awards  

If a Participant is eligible for treatment under this Article 18, he or she 
shall be paid, in a single lump-sum cash payment, as soon as practicable but 
in no event later than 90 days after the date of his or her termination of 
employment, all of his or her Units of Common Stock, Freestanding SARs, stock 
options (including incentive stock options), Stock Awards (including those 
issued as Performance Awards under Article 7), performance units and shares 
(including those earned as a result of the application of Section 18.4 
above), all other outstanding stock-based Awards (including those earned as a 
result of the application of Section 18.5 above and those granted by the 
Committee pursuant to its authority under Subsection 4.2(m) hereof), and all 
other outstanding Awards.

18.8 Deferred Awards  

If a Participant is eligible for treatment under this Article 18, all of his 
or her deferred Awards for which payment has not been received as of the date 
of his or her termination of employment shall be paid to the Participant in a 
single lump-sum cash payment as soon as practicable, but in no event later 
than 90 days after the date of the Participant's termination.  For purposes 
of making such payment, the value of all Awards which are stock based shall 
be determined by the Change In Control Price.

18.9 Section 16 of Exchange Act 

     (Intentionally Omitted)

18.10 Miscellaneous  

Upon a Change In Control, (i) the provisions of Sections 14.2, 14.3 and 19.3 
hereof shall become null and void and of no force and effect insofar as they 
apply to a Participant who has been terminated under the conditions described 
in Section 18.1 above; and (ii) no action, including, but not by way of 
limitation, the amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan, shall be 
taken which would affect the rights of any Participant or the operation of 
the Plan with respect to any Award to which the Participant may have become 
entitled hereunder on or prior to the date of the Change In Control or to 
which he or she may become entitled as a result of such Change In Control.

18.11 Legal Fees  

Kodak shall pay all legal fees and related expenses incurred by a Participant 
in seeking to obtain or enforce any payment, benefit or right he or she may 
be entitled to under the Plan after a Change In Control; provided, however, 
the Participant shall be required to repay any such amounts to Kodak to the 
extent a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final and non-appealable 
order setting forth the determination that the position taken by the 
Participant was frivolous or advanced in bad faith.


ARTICLE 19  --  MISCELLANEOUS

19.1 Nonassignability

No Awards or any other payment under the Plan shall be subject in any manner 
to alienation, anticipation, sale, transfer (except by will or the laws of 
descent and distribution), assignment, pledge, or encumbrance, nor shall any 
Award be payable to or exercisable by anyone other than the Participant to 
whom it was granted.

19.2 Withholding Taxes

The Company shall be entitled to deduct from any payment under the Plan, 
regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income 
and employment taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such 
payment or may require the Participant to pay to it such tax prior to and as 
a condition of the making of such payment.  In accordance with any applicable 
administrative guidelines it establishes, the Committee may allow a 
Participant to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld from an 
Award by withholding from any payment of Common Stock due as a result of such 
Award, or by permitting the Participant to deliver to the Company, shares of 
Common Stock having a fair market value, as determined by the Committee, 
equal to the amount of such required withholding taxes.
<PAGE>

19.3 Amendments to Awards

The Committee may at any time unilaterally amend any unexercised, unearned, 
or unpaid Award, including, but not by way of limitation, Awards earned but 
not yet paid, to the extent it deems appropriate; provided, however, that any 
such amendment which, in the opinion of the Committee, is adverse to the 
Participant shall require the Participant's consent.

19.4 Regulatory Approvals and Listings

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Company 
shall have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates of Common Stock 
evidencing Stock Awards or any other Award resulting in the payment of Common 
Stock prior to (i) the obtaining of any approval from any governmental agency 
which the Company shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary or 
advisable, (ii) the admission of such shares to listing on the stock exchange 
on which the Common Stock may be listed, and (iii) the completion of any 
registration or other qualification of said shares under any state or Federal 
law or ruling of any governmental body which the Company shall, in its sole 
discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable.

19.5 No Right to Continued Employment or Grants

Participation in the Plan shall not give any Employee any right to remain in 
the employ of Kodak or any Subsidiary.  Kodak or, in the case of employment 
with a Subsidiary, the Subsidiary, reserves the right to terminate any 
Employee at any time.  Further, the adoption of this Plan shall not be deemed 
to give any Employee or any other individual any right to be selected as a 
Participant or to be granted an Award.

19.6 Amendment/Termination

The Committee may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time with or without 
prior notice.  In addition, the Committee may, from time to time and with or 
without prior notice, amend the Plan in any manner, but may not without 
shareholder approval adopt any amendment which would require the vote of the 
shareholders of Kodak pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code, but only 
insofar as such amendment affects Covered Employees.

19.7 Governing Law

The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of New York, except as superseded by applicable Federal Law.

19.8 No Right, Title, or Interest in Company Assets

No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder as a result of 
participation in the Plan until the date of issuance of a stock certificate 
in his or her name, and, in the case of restricted shares of Common Stock, 
such rights are granted to the Participant under the Plan.  To the extent any 
person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, 
such rights shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured creditor of 
the Company and the Participant shall not have any rights in or against any 
specific assets of the Company.  All of the Awards granted under the Plan 
shall be unfunded.

19.9 Section 16 of the Exchange Act

In order to avoid any Exchange Act violations, the Committee may, from time 
to time, impose additional restrictions upon an Award, including but not 
limited to, restrictions regarding tax withholdings and restrictions 
regarding the Participant's ability to exercise Awards under the Company's 
broker-assisted exercise program.

19.10 No Guarantee of Tax Consequences

No person connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited 
to, Kodak and its Subsidiaries and their directors, officers, agents and 
employees makes any representation, commitment, or guarantee that any tax 
treatment, including, but not limited to, Federal, state and local income, 
estate and gift tax treatment, will be applicable with respect to amounts 
deferred under the Plan, or paid to or for the benefit of a Participant under 
the Plan, or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a 
Participant on account of participation in the Plan.

19.11 Compliance with Section 162(m)

If any provision of the Plan, other than the application of those contained 
in Articles 17 or 18 hereof, would cause the Awards granted to a Covered 
Person not to qualify as "Performance-Based Compensation" under Section 
162(m) of the Code, that provision, insofar as it pertains to the Covered 
Person, shall be severed from, and shall be deemed not to be a part of, this 
Plan, but the other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect. 

19.12 Other Benefits

No Award granted under the Plan shall be considered compensation for purposes 
of computing benefits under any retirement plan of the Company nor affect any 
benefits or compensation under any other benefit or compensation plan of the 
Company now or subsequently in effect.

5.   Subsection (b) of Section 6 entitled "Long-Term Incentive Programs" is 
     amended to add "s" to "Award" in the sub-caption, to insert "(i)" 
     immediately after the sub-caption and to add a new subsection 6(b)(ii) 
     as follows:

          (ii) As soon as practicable after the execution of the Second 
               Amendment, the Company shall grant the Executive 50,000 shares 
               of stock substantially in the form attached to the Amendment 
               as Exhibit A, such stock to be subject to forfeiture if the 
               Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Section 11(c) or 
               11(f) below prior to the end of the Term of Employment.

6.   Subsection (c) of Section 6 is amended to add "s" to "Award" in the 
     sub-caption, to insert "(i)" immediately after the sub-caption and to 
     add a new subsection (ii) as follows:

               Amendment, the Company shall grant the Executive a 10-year 
               option, substantially in the form attached to this Amendment 
               as Exhibit B, to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Stock (the 
               "Option"). The exercise price of the Option shall be the  
               closing market price for the Stock on the New York Stock 
               Exchange on the date of grant.

7.   Subsection (a) of Section 9 entitled "Supplemental Pension" is amended 
     to read as follows:

     (a)  The Executive shall be entitled to a pension benefit to be

     Income Plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Plan") 
     (without regard to any limitations that may be applicable under the 
     Internal Revenue Code), subject to adjustment for any future 
     enhancements in that formula.  For purposes of determining his benefit 
     under this Section 9(a), upon execution of the Second Amendment, the 
     Executive shall be deemed credited, for all Plan purposes, with 22 years 
     of service under the Plan in addition to credited service for actual 
     employment with the Company and shall be deemed to have 5 years of age

               residence at a price equal to the greater of (x) the 
               Executive's purchase price plus the cost of documented 
               improvements or (y) the then fair market value.  The fair 
               market value shall be determined by a nationally-recognized 
               appraiser, as mutually agreed by the Parties.

9.   Subsections (h) and (i) of Section 11 entitled "Termination of 
     Employment" are redesignated subsections (i) and (j), respectively and a

          shall be deemed a termination for an "Approved Reason" under the 
          Administrative Guides or other operating guidelines under the 1990 
          Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan and the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term

10.  Section 12 is amended to add the word "Non-competition" at the end of 
     the heading and to add a new subsection (c) as follows:

          (c) During the Term of Employment and for the period ending on the

          an officer of the Company, engage in Competition, as defined in 
          Section 1(f) above. 

11.  All of the remaining terms of the Employment Agreement, to the extent 
     they are not inconsistent with the terms hereof, shall remain in full

To: George M.C. Fisher


     You are granted 50,000 shares of Eastman Kodak Company (the "Company") 
Common Stock (the "Restricted Shares"). The Restricted Shares are granted 
under the Eastman Kodak Company 1995 Omnibus Long-Term Compensation Plan (the 
"Plan") and are subject to the terms of the Plan and the following 
conditions:

     1.   The Restricted Shares awarded hereunder shall be promptly issued 
and a certificate(a) for such shares shall be issued in your name.  You shall 
thereupon be a shareholder of all the shares represented by the 
certificate(a).  As such, you shall have all the rights of a shareholder with 
respect to such shares, including, but not limited to, the right to vote such 
shares and to receive all dividends and other distributions (subject to 
Paragraph 2 below) paid with respect to them, provided, however, that the 
shares shall be subject to the restrictions in Paragraph 4 below.  The stock 
certificates representing such shares shall be imprinted with a legend 
stating that the shares represented thereby are restricted shares subject to 
the terms and conditions of this Grant Notice and, as such may not be sold, 
exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except 
in accordance with the terms of this Grant Notice.  Each transfer agent for 
the Common Stock shall be instructed to like effect in respect of such 
shares.  In aid of such restrictions, you shall immediately upon receipt of 
the certificate(a) therefore, deposit such certificate(a) together with a 
stock power or other like instrument of transfer, appropriately endorsed in 
blank, with an escrow agent designated by the Committee, which may be the 
Company, under a deposit agreement containing such terms and conditions as 
the Committee shall approve, the expenses of such escrow to be borne by the 
Company.

     2.   If under Section 6.2 of the Plan, entitled "Adjustment to Shares," 
you, as the owner of the Restricted Shares, shall be entitled to new, 
additional or different shares of stock or securities, the certificate or 
certificates for, or other evidences of, such new, additional or different 
shares or securities together with a stock power or other instrument of 
transfer appropriately endorsed, shall be imprinted with a legend as provided 
in Paragraph l above, deposited by you under the deposit agreement provided 
for therein, and subject to the restrictions provided for in Paragraph 4 
below.

     3.   The term "Restricted Period" with respect to the Restricted
Shares, shall mean the period beginning on February 25, 1997 and ending on 
January 1, 2001.

     4.   During the Restricted Period, none of the Restricted Shares, shall 
be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed 
of except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any attempt by 
you to dispose of your shares in any such manner shall result in the 
immediate forfeiture of such shares and any other shares then held by the 
designated escrow agent on your behalf.

     5.   Subject to Paragraph 6 below, if your employment is terminated 
pursuant to Section ll(c) or ll(f) of the Employment Agreement between you 
and the Company dated October 27, 1993, as amended through February 25, 1997 
(the "Employment Agreement"), at any time before the Restriction Period ends, 
you shall immediately forfeit all of the Restricted Shares then held on your 
behalf by the designated escrow agent.

     6.   The restrictions set forth in Paragraph 4 above, with respect to 
the Restricted Shares held by the designated escrow agent on your behalf, 
will lapse upon the earlier of:

     (i)  the expiration of the Restricted Period; or
    (ii)  the termination of your employment under Section ll(a), ll(b), 
          ll(d), or ll(e) of the Employment Agreement.

defined in Section 1(f) of the Employment Agreement, you shall forfeit the 
Restricted Shares.

     8.   The Company, or the designated escrow agent at the request of the 
Company, shall be entitled to deduct from the Restricted Shares the amount of 
all applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld unless you 
make other arrangements with the Company for the timely payment of such 
taxes.

                           NOTICE OF STOCK OPTION
                         GRANTED FEBRUARY 25, 1997
                              ("Grant Notice")



To:  George M. C. Fisher

          You are granted a Nonqualified Stock Option to purchase 2,000,000 
shares (See Footnote 1) of Eastman Kodak Company (the "Company") Common Stock 
at $      per share.  This option is granted subject to the terms of this 
Grant Notice.

          1.   This option shall become exercisable (vested) in 25% 
cumulative annual installments starting one year after grant.

          2.   This option, unless sooner terminated or exercised in full, 
shall expire on February 24, 2007.

          3.   If your employment is terminated due to death, Disability, 
Retirement after December 31, 2000 or termination for an Approved Reason, 
this option shall immediately become exercisable and vested in full and shall 
continue to be exercisable until its scheduled expiration date under 
Paragraph 2 above or, if sooner, its exercise in full.  If your employment is 
terminated for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement or an 
Approved Reason, any portion of the option exercisable at the time of such 
termination shall not be exercisable beyond the 60th day following the date 
of your termination of employment and any portion of the option not 
exercisable at the time of your termination shall be immediately forfeited.

          4.   In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the 
Employment Agreement), this option shall immediately become vested and 
exercisable in full and shall continue to be exercisable until its scheduled 
expiration date under Paragraph 2 above or, if sooner, its exercise in full.  
Termination of your employment for any reason following such Change in 
Control shall not affect this option.

          5.   You may exercise this option regardless of whether any other 
option you have been granted by the Company remains unexercised.

          6.   The option price for the shares for which this option is 
exercised by you shall be paid by you, on the date the option is exercised, 
in cash, in shares of Common Stock owned by you or a combination of the 
foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment of the option 
price shall be valued at its "fair market value".  For purposes of this 
paragraph, "fair market value" shall mean the opening price of the Common 
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise; provided, 
however, if the Common Stock is not traded on such date, then the opening 
price on the immediately preceding date on which Common Stock is traded shall 
be used.

          7.   This option shall not be treated as an incentive stock option 
under the Internal Revenue Code.

          8.   You may pay the amount of taxes required to be withheld upon 
exercise of the option by (i) delivering a check made payable to the Company 
or (ii) delivering to the Company at the time of such exercise shares of 
Common Stock having a "fair market value", as determined in accordance with 
Paragraph 6 above, equal to the amount of such withholding taxes.

          9.   You shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with 
respect to the shares of Common Stock covered by this option except to the 
extent one or more certificates for such shares shall be delivered to you 
upon the exercise of the option.

          10.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 8 and 9 above to the contrary, you 
may exercise this option by way of the Company's broker-assisted stock option 
exercise program to the extent such program is available at the time of such 
exercise.  Pursuant to the terms of such program, the amount of any taxes 
required to be withheld upon exercise of any options under the program shall 
be paid in cash directly to the Company.

          11.  The obligation of the Company to sell and deliver any stock 
under this option is specifically subject to all applicable laws, rules, 
regulations and required governmental approvals.  The Company shall use its 
reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals as promptly as practicable.

          12.  If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall, at 
any time, be increased or decreased or changed or converted into cash or 
other property as a result of (a) any subdivision or consolidation of shares, 
stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reclassification or similar 
capital adjustment or (b) any combination, exchange of shares or similar 
event arising from the Company's participation in any corporate merger, 
consolidation or similar transaction in which the Company is the surviving 
entity and is not substantially or completely liquidated, the number and kind 
of shares with respect to which this option may thereafter be exercised and 
the exercise price shall be appropriately adjusted.  Any fractional shares 
resulting from such adjustments shall be disregarded.

          13.  The Company shall use its best efforts so that on or prior to 
December 31, 1997, all shares received by you on any exercise of the option 
shall be, and shall remain, (1) fully registered (at the Company's expense) 
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), both for 
issuance and for resale, pursuant to a registration on Form S-3 under the 
1933 Act or such successor procedure that provides comparable opportunity 
under the 1933 Act for issuance and resale; (2) fully registered or qualified 
(at the Company's expense), under such state securities laws as you may 
reasonably request, both for issuance and for resale; and (3) listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

          14.  Any notice by you to the Company and any notice by the Company 
to you shall be in writing and shall be deemed duly given if mailed to the 
other at the address you or the Company have last specified to the other.

          15.  The validity and construction of this Grant Notice shall be 
governed by the laws of the State of New York without reference to principles 
of conflict of laws.

          16.  "Termination for an Approved Reason" shall include, without 
limitation, (i) a Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination 
Without Cause under Section 11(d) of the Employment Agreement between you and 
the Company dated as of October, 1993, as amended through [February] 1997 
(the "Employment Agreement"); (ii) a Termination of Employment Following a 
Change in Control under Section 11(e) of the Employment Agreement; or (iii) a 
Termination for an Approved Reason under Section 11(h) of the Employment 
Agreement.

          17.  "Disability" shall have the same meaning as ascribed to it 
under Section 1(h) of the Employment Agreement.

          18.  "Retirement" shall mean the occurrence of your retirement as 
determined in accordance with Section 9 of the Employment Agreement.

          19.  During the term of your employment and for the period ending 
on the earlier of December 31, 2002 or the second anniversary of the 
termination of your employment under the Employment Agreement, if you engage 
in Competition, as defined in Section 1(f) of the Employment Agreement, 
without the written consent of an officer of the Company, you shall 
immediately forfeit all unexercised option shares.

          20.  This option is non-assignable and non-transferable, in whole 
or in part, other than (i) by gratuitous transfers to immediate family 
members, to trusts for their benefit, or to limited partnerships in which 
immediate family members are the sole partners, (ii) by will or under the 
laws of descent and distribution, or (iii), on your death, to a beneficiary 
designated in writing by you, with any such permitted transferee to succeed 
to your rights and obligations under the option to the extent of such 
transfer.

  1  Actual grant shall be for 2,000,000 shares less the number of shares 
     that shall be granted concurrently under a stock option intended to 
     qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal 
     Revenue Code.  Such option grant shall be in substantially the same form 
     as this grant except to the extent necessary to constitute an incentive 
     stock option under Section 422.

in accordance with the terms of this Grant Notice. Each transfer agent for 
the Common Stock shall be instructed to like effect in respect of such

                              ("Grant Notice")


To:  George M. C. Fisher

          You are granted an Incentive Stock Option to purchase 3,328 shares 
of Eastman Kodak Company (the "Company") Common Stock at $90.125 per share.  
This option is granted under the Eastman Kodak Company 1995 Omnibus Long-Term 
Compensation Plan (the "Plan") subject to the terms of this Grant Notice.

          1.   This option shall become exercisable (vested) in accordance 
with the following schedule:

          February 25, 1999             1109
          February 25, 2000             1109
          February 25, 2001             1110

          2.   This option, unless sooner terminated or exercised in full, 
shall expire on February 24, 2007.

          3.   If your employment is terminated due to death, Disability, 
Retirement after December 31, 2000 or termination for an Approved Reason, 
this option shall immediately become exercisable and vested in full and shall 
continue to be exercisable until its scheduled expiration date under 
Paragraph 2 above or, if sooner, its exercise in full.  If your employment is 
terminated for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement after 
December 31, 2000 or an Approved Reason, any portion of the option 
exercisable at the time of such termination shall not be exercisable beyond 
the 60th day following the date of your termination of employment and any 
portion of the option not exercisable at the time of your termination shall 
be immediately forfeited.

          4.   In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the 
Employment Agreement between you and the Company dated October 27, 1993, as 
amended through February 25, 1997 [the "Employment Agreement]), this option 
shall immediately become vested and exercisable in full and shall continue to 
be exercisable until its scheduled expiration date under Paragraph 2 above 
or, if sooner, its exercise in full.  Termination of your employment for any 
reason following such Change in Control shall not affect this option.

          5.   You may exercise this option regardless of whether any other 
option you have been granted by the Company remains unexercised.

          6.   The option price for the shares for which this option is 
exercised by you shall be paid by you, on the date the option is exercised, 
in cash, in shares of Common Stock owned by you or a combination of the 
foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment of the option 
price shall be valued at its "fair market value".  For purposes of this 
paragraph, "fair market value" shall mean the opening price of the Common 
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise; provided, 
however, if the Common Stock is not traded on such date, then the opening 
price on the immediately preceding date on which Common Stock is traded shall 
be used.

          7.   This option is an incentive stock option within the meaning of 
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  To the extent any 
provision in this Grant Notice is determined to be inconsistent or contrary 
to Section 422, such provision shall automatically without any further action 
be changed, effective as of the date of the option's grant, so as to be 
consistent and in compliance with such section.

          8.   You may pay the amount of taxes required to be withheld upon 
exercise of the option by (i) delivering a check made payable to the Company 
or (ii) delivering to the Company at the time of such exercise shares of 
Common Stock having a "fair market value", as determined in accordance with 
Paragraph 6 above, equal to the amount of such withholding taxes.

          9.   You shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with 
respect to the shares of Common Stock covered by this option except to the 
extent one or more certificates for such shares shall be delivered to you 
upon the exercise of the option.

          10.  The obligation of the Company to sell and deliver any stock 
under this option is specifically subject to all applicable laws, rules, 
regulations and required governmental approvals.  The Company shall use its 
reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals as promptly as practicable.

          11.  If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall, at 
any time, be increased or decreased or changed or converted into cash or 
other property as a result of (a) any subdivision or consolidation of shares, 
stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reclassification or similar 
capital adjustment or (b) any combination, exchange of shares or similar 
event arising from the Company's participation in any corporate merger, 
consolidation or similar transaction in which the Company is the surviving 
entity and is not substantially or completely liquidated, the number and kind 
of shares with respect to which this option may thereafter be exercised and

                              ("Grant Notice")


To:  George M. C. Fisher

          You are granted a Nonqualified Stock Option to purchase 1,996,672 
shares of Eastman Kodak Company (the "Company") Common Stock at $90.125 per 
share.  This option is granted under the Eastman Kodak Company 1997 Stock 
Option Plan (the "Plan") subject to the terms of this Grant Notice.

          1.   This option shall become exercisable (vested) in accordance 
with the following schedule:

          February 25, 1998             500,000
          February 25, 1999             498,891
          February 25, 2000             498,891
          February 25, 2001             498,890

          2.   This option, unless sooner terminated or exercised in full, 
shall expire on February 24, 2007.

          3.   If your employment is terminated due to death, Disability, 
Retirement after December 31, 2000 or termination for an Approved Reason, 
this option shall immediately become exercisable and vested in full and shall 
continue to be exercisable until its scheduled expiration date under 
Paragraph 2 above or, if sooner, its exercise in full.  If your employment is 
terminated for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement after 
December 31, 2000 or an Approved Reason, any portion of the option 
exercisable at the time of such termination shall not be exercisable beyond 
the 60th day following the date of your termination of employment and any 
portion of the option not exercisable at the time of your termination shall 
be immediately forfeited.

          4.   In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the 
Employment Agreement between you and the Company dated October 27, 1993, as 
amended through February 25, 1997 [the "Employment Agreement]), this option 
shall immediately become vested and exercisable in full and shall continue to 
be exercisable until its scheduled expiration date under Paragraph 2 above 
or, if sooner, its exercise in full.  Termination of your employment for any 
reason following such Change in Control shall not affect this option.

          5.   You may exercise this option regardless of whether any other 
option you have been granted by the Company remains unexercised.

          6.   The option price for the shares for which this option is 
exercised by you shall be paid by you, on the date the option is exercised, 
in cash, in shares of Common Stock owned by you or a combination of the 
foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment of the option 
price shall be valued at its "fair market value".  For purposes of this 
paragraph, "fair market value" shall mean the opening price of the Common 
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of exercise; provided, 
however, if the Common Stock is not traded on such date, then the opening 
price on the immediately preceding date on which Common Stock is traded shall 
be used.

          7.   This option shall not be treated as an incentive stock option 
under the Internal Revenue Code.

          8.   You may pay the amount of taxes required to be withheld upon 
exercise of the option by (i) delivering a check made payable to the Company 
or (ii) delivering to the Company at the time of such exercise shares of 
Common Stock having a "fair market value", as determined in accordance with 
Paragraph 6 above, equal to the amount of such withholding taxes.

          9.   You shall not have any of the rights of a shareholder with 
respect to the shares of Common Stock covered by this option except to the 
extent one or more certificates for such shares shall be delivered to you 
upon the exercise of the option.

          10.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 8 and 9 above to the contrary, you 
may exercise this option by way of the Company's broker-assisted stock option 
exercise program to the extent such program is available at the time of such 
exercise.  Pursuant to the terms of such program, the amount of any taxes 
required to be withheld upon exercise of any options under the program shall 
be paid in cash directly to the Company.

          11.  The obligation of the Company to sell and deliver any stock 
under this option is specifically subject to all applicable laws, rules, 
regulations and required governmental approvals.  The Company shall use its 
reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals as promptly as practicable.

          12.  If the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall, at 
any time, be increased or decreased or changed or converted into cash or 
other property as a result of (a) any subdivision or consolidation of shares, 
stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reclassification or similar 
capital adjustment or (b) any combination, exchange of shares or similar 
event arising from the Company's participation in any corporate merger, 
consolidation or similar transaction in which the Company is the surviving 
entity and is not substantially or completely liquidated, the number and kind 
of shares with respect to which this option may thereafter be exercised and 
the exercise price shall be appropriately adjusted.  Any fractional shares 
resulting from such adjustments shall be disregarded.

          13.  The Company shall use its best efforts so that on or prior to 
December 31, 1997, all shares received by you on any exercise of the option 
shall be, and shall remain, (1) fully registered (at the Company's expense) 
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), both for 
issuance and for resale, pursuant to a registration on Form S-3 under the 
1933 Act or such successor procedure that provides comparable opportunity 
under the 1933 Act for issuance and resale; (2) fully registered or qualified 
(at the Company's expense), under such state securities laws as you may 
reasonably request, both for issuance and for resale; and (3) listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange.

          14.  Any notice by you to the Company and any notice by the Company

          15.  The validity and construction of this Grant Notice shall be 
governed by the laws of the State of New York without reference to principles 
of conflict of laws.

          16.  "Termination for an Approved Reason" shall include, without 
limitation, (i) a Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination 
Without Cause under Section 11(d) of the Employment Agreement; (ii) a 
Termination of Employment Following a Change in Control under Section 11(e) 
of the Employment Agreement; or (iii) a Termination for an Approved Reason

          18.  "Retirement" shall mean the occurrence of your retirement as 
determined in accordance with Section 9 of the Employment Agreement.

          19.  During the term of your employment and for the period ending 
on the earlier of December 31, 2002 or the second anniversary of the 
termination of your employment under the Employment Agreement, if you engage 
in Competition, as defined in Section 1(f) of the Employment Agreement, 
without the written consent of an officer of the Company, you shall 
immediately forfeit all unexercised option shares.

          20.  This option is non-assignable and non-transferable, in whole 
or in part, other than (i) by gratuitous transfers to immediate family 
members, to trusts for their benefit, or to limited partnerships in which 
immediate family members are the sole partners, (ii) by will or under the 
laws of descent and distribution, or (iii), on your death, to a beneficiary

                  FIRST AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     THIS AGREEMENT (the "First Amendment"), made as of the 21st day of 
January, 1997, is intended to amend a certain Employment Agreement, 
hereinafter the "Employment Agreement," dated as of the 11th day of February, 
1994 by and between Harry L. Kavetas (the "Executive") and the Eastman Kodak 
Company (the "Company");

     WHEREAS, Kodak maintains a welfare benefit plan, entitled the "Family 
Protection Program" (hereinafter "FPP"); and

     WHEREAS, one of the welfare benefits provided to certain eligible 
participants of the FPP is a Post-Retirement Survivor Income Benefit 
(hereinafter "Post-Retirement SIB"); and 

     WHEREAS, in general, the Post-Retirement SIB provides to the eligible 
survivors of a participant a percentage of the participant's retirement 
income benefit after the participant's death; and

     WHEREAS, the Employment Agreement contains certain terms and conditions 
regarding the Executive's eligibility for and participation in the Company's 
benefits plans; and

     WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company desire to clarify and amend the 
Employment Agreement insofar as it pertains to the Executive's eligibility 
for and coverage under the Post-Retirement SIB; and

     WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company further desire to clarify the 
Executive's eligibility for and coverage under the retiree welfare benefits 
provided by the Company; and

     WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company additionally desire to clarify 
several other provisions of Section 8 of the Employment Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, based upon the mutual promises and conditions contained 
herein, the parties hereto do hereby agree that the Employment Agreement 
shall be amended as follows:


          1.   The Employment Agreement is amended to add the following as 
new subsection (e) to Section 8 entitled "Supplemental Pension": 

     (e)  Post-Retirement Survivor Income Benefit.  

          (i)  Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to 
               the contrary, the Executive shall be treated as if he were an 
               eligible participant for the Post-Retirement Survivor Income 
               Benefit (hereinafter "Post-Retirement SIB") as set forth in 
               the Company's Family Protection Program in effect on the date 
               of the Agreement (the "FPP").  

          (ii) The benefit, if any, payable by virtue of the terms of this 
               Section 8(e) shall, except as otherwise specifically provided 
               in this Section 8(e), be paid as if the benefit were payable 
               under the terms and conditions of the FPP as in effect on the 
               date of the Agreement.

          (iii) The amount of the Executive's Post-Retirement SIB coverage
               shall be calculated pursuant to Section 7.2 of FPP; except, 
               however, that for purposes of Step 1, the Executive's "full 
               accrued (not reduced for early retirement) monthly retirement 
               income benefit under KRIP" shall be calculated by taking into 
               account any deemed service credited to the Executive under 
               Section 8(b), as amended.
<PAGE>

          (iv) The benefit, if any, payable by virtue of this Section 8(e) 
               shall be paid out of the Company's general assets, not subject 
               to offset for any benefits from a prior employer, and not 
               funded in any manner.


          2.   The last sentence of subsection (a) of Section 8, entitled 
"Supplemental Pension," is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

     For purposes of this Section 8, "supplements thereto" shall include the 
     Kodak Excess Retirement Income Plan and the Kodak Unfunded Retirement 
     Income Plan.


          3.   The last sentence of subsection (b) of Section 8, entitled 
"Supplemental Pension," is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

     (In the event of a sixth year of employment, the Executive shall be 
     credited with two more years of service, one year of actual service and 
     one year of additional, deemed service, bringing the Executive's total 
     years of service to 32.)


          4.   The last sentence of subsection (c) of Section 7 of the 
Employment Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety.


          5.   The Employment Agreement is amended to add the following as 
new subsection (d) to Section 7 entitled "Employee Benefit Programs":

     (d)  Retiree Welfare Benefits.

          (i)  Subject to Section 7(d)(ii), for purposes of any retiree 
               welfare benefit of the Company for which the Executive may be 
               eligible, the Executive shall for all plan purposes be 
               credited with any deemed service credited to him under Section 
               8(b).

          (ii) The terms of Section 7(d)(i) shall apply with regards to a 
               particular Company-provided retiree welfare benefit if at any 
               time, and from time to time, during the Executive's 
               retirement, he is not eligible for a comparable retiree 
               welfare benefit under any plan of a prior employer.  For 
               purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, whether a 
               retiree welfare benefit under any plan of a prior employer is 
               comparable to a Company-provided welfare benefit shall be 
               measured in terms of the following factors: (1) its 
               availability to the Executive, (2) the scope and amount of its 
               benefit coverage, and (3) its cost to the Executive.  If in 
               measuring a prior employer's retiree welfare benefit against a 
               similar Company-provided retiree welfare benefit (determined 
               as if Section 7(d)(i) applied), one or more of the foregoing 
               factors is determined not to be comparable, then the retiree 
               welfare benefits themselves shall not be considered 
               comparable.  If a prior employer of the Executive maintains a 
               retiree welfare benefit for which the Executive is eligible, 
               but it is determined that such retiree welfare benefit is not, 
               under the terms of this Section 7(d)(ii), comparable to a 
               Company-provided retiree welfare benefit, then the terms of 
               Section 7(d)(i) shall apply irrespective of whether the 
               Executive determines to maintain coincident coverage under the 
               retiree welfare benefit of such prior employer.

          6.   The Employment Agreement is amended to add the following as 
new subsection (e) to Section 7 entitled "Employee Benefit Programs":

     (e)  Survivor Welfare Benefits.

          (i)  Subject to Section 7(e)(ii) below, for purposes of any 
               survivor welfare benefit of the Company for which any spouse, 
               child, parent, or survivor (collectively "Survivor") may be 
               eligible under the relevant welfare benefit plan, the 
               Executive's service with the Company shall for all plan 
               purposes be calculated by taking into account any deemed 
               service credited to the Executive under Section 8(b).

          (ii) The terms of Section 7(e)(i) above shall apply with regards to 
               a particular Company-provided survivor welfare benefit if at 
               any time, and from time to time, the Survivor is not eligible 
               for a comparable survivor welfare benefit under any plan of a 
               prior employer.  For purposes of the immediately preceding 
               sentence, whether a survivor welfare benefit under any plan of 
               a prior employer is comparable to a Company-provided survivor 
               welfare benefit shall be measured in terms of the following 
               factors: (1) its availability to the Survivor, (2) the scope 
               and amount of its benefit coverage, and (3) its cost to the 
               Survivor.  If in measuring a prior employer's survivor welfare 
               benefit against a similar Company-provided survivor welfare 
               benefit (determined as of Section 7(e)(i) applied), one or 
               more of the foregoing factors is determined not to be 
               comparable, then the survivor welfare benefits themselves 
               shall not be considered comparable.  If a prior employer of 
               the Executive maintains a survivor welfare benefit for which 
               the Survivor is eligible, but it is determined that such 
               survivor welfare benefit is not, under the terms of this 
               Section 7(e)(ii), comparable to a Company-provided survivor 
               welfare benefit, then the terms of Section 7(e)(i) shall apply 
               irrespective of whether the Survivor determines to maintain 
               coincident coverage under the survivor welfare benefit of such 
               prior employer.


          7.   All of the remaining terms of the Agreement, to the extent 
they are not inconsistent with the terms hereof, shall remain in full force 
and effect, without amendment or modification.


     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this First 
Amendment as of the date and year first above written.

               option, substantially in the form attached to this Amendment 
               as Exhibit D, to purchase 200,000 shares of Stock (the 
               "Option"). The exercise price of the Option shall be the  
               closing market price for the Stock on the New York Stock 
               Exchange on the date of grant.

5.   Subsection (b) of Section 8 entitled "Supplemental Pension" is amended 
     to read as follows:

     (b)  For purposes of establishing (i) the total amount of "Accrued 
          Service" used to calculate the Executive's retirement and 
          pre-retirement survivor income benefits under KRIP, (ii) the 
          Executive's "Total Service" for purposes of determining the 
          applicability of any early retirement reduction factor contained 
          in KRIP, and (iii) the Executive's vesting service, Executive 
          shall be credited, for each year of service earned under the 
          terms of KRIP prior to February 11, 1999, with six years of 
          service (one year of actual service and five years of additional, 
          deemed service) and, for each year of service earned under the 
          terms of KRIP on or after February 11, 1999 and prior to February 
          11, 2001, with four and one half years of service (one year of 
          actual service and three and one half years of additional, deemed 
          service).  Thus, in the event the Executive remains employed by 
          the Company throughout the Term of Employment, he shall be 
          credited in total with thirty nine years of service (seven years 
          of actual service and thirty two years of additional, deemed 
          service) for the foregoing plan purposes.  In the event the 
          Executive's employment terminates pursuant to Section 11(a), 
          11(b) or 11(d) between February 10, 1999 and February 10, 2001, 
          the credited service (i.e., both the actual and the deemed) for 
          the year in which the termination occurs shall be prorated based 
          on the number of days of employment in that year divided by 365.

6.   All of the remaining terms of the Employment Agreement, to the extent 
     they are not inconsistent with the terms hereof, shall remain in full 
     force and effect, without amendment or modification.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Second 
Amendment as of the date and year first above written.

                   NOTICE OF AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK
                       GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS
                         EFFECTIVE MARCH   , 1997
                             PURSUANT TO THE
               EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1995 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM
                            COMPENSATION PLAN


1.   Background.  Under Article 10 of the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term 
     Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), the Committee may, among other things, 
     award restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock to those Key 
     Employees as the Committee in its discretion may determine, subject to 
     such terms, conditions and restrictions as it deems appropriate.


2.   Award.  Effective March   , 1997, (the "Grant Date"), the Committee 
     granted, to Harry L. Kavetas (the "Participant") an Award of ten 
     thousand (10,000) restricted shares of Common Stock ("Restricted 
     Shares").  This Award is granted under the Plan, subject to the terms 
     and conditions of the Plan and those set forth in this Notice of Award 
     of Restricted Stock ("Award Notice").


3.   Terms and Conditions of Restricted Shares.  The following terms and 
     conditions shall apply to the Restricted Shares:

     (a)  Issuance.  The Restricted Shares awarded hereunder to the 
          Participant shall be promptly issued and a certificate(s) for 
          such shares shall be issued in the Participant's name.  The 
          Participant shall thereupon be a shareowner of all the shares 
          represented by the certificate(s).  As such, the Participant 
          shall have all the rights of a shareowner with respect to such 
          shares, including but not limited to, the right to vote such 
          shares and to receive all dividends and other distributions 
          (subject to Section 3(b)) paid with respect to them, provided, 
          however, that the shares shall be subject to the restrictions in 
          Section 3(d).  The stock certificates representing the Restricted 
          Shares shall be imprinted with a legend stating that the shares 
          represented thereby are restricted shares subject to the terms 
          and conditions of this Award Notice and, as such, may not be 
          sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, or 
          otherwise disposed of except in accordance with this Award 
          Notice.  Each transfer agent for the Common Stock shall be 
          instructed to like effect in respect of such shares.  In aid of 
          such restrictions, the Participant shall immediately upon receipt 
          of the certificate(s) therefor, deposit such certificate(s) 
          together with a stock power or other like instrument of transfer, 
          appropriately endorsed in blank, with the Company.

     (b)  Stock Splits, Dividends, etc.  If under Section 6.2 of the Plan, 
          entitled "Adjustment to Shares," the Participant, as the owner of 
          the Restricted Shares, shall be entitled to new, additional, or 
          different shares of stock or securities, the certificate or 
          certificates for, or other evidences of, such new, additional, or 
          different shares or securities, together with a stock power or 
          other instrument of transfer appropriately endorsed in blank, 
          shall be imprinted with a legend as provided in Section 3(a) 
          above, deposited by the Participant with the Company as provided 
          for therein, and subject to the restrictions provided for in 
          Section 3(d) below.

     (c)  Restriction Period.  The "Restriction Period" for the Restricted 
          Shares shall begin on the Grant Date and terminate, subject to 
          Section 4 below, on February 10, 2001.
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 153

     (d)  Restrictions on Restricted Shares.  The restrictions to which the 
          Restricted Shares are subject are:

          (i)  Nonalienation.  During the Restriction Period, the 
               Restricted Shares shall not be sold, exchanged, transferred, 
               assigned, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of 
               except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any 
               attempt by the Participant to dispose of a Restricted Share 
               in any such manner shall result in the immediate forfeiture 
               of such share and any other Restricted Shares then held by 
               the Company on the Participant's behalf.

          (ii) Continuous Employment.  Except as set forth in Section 4 
               below, if the Participant's employment is terminated for any 
               reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, before the 
               Restriction Period ends, he shall immediately forfeit all of 
               the Restricted Shares.

     (e)  Lapse of Restrictions.  The restrictions set forth in Section 
          3(d) above, with respect to the Restricted Shares held by the 
          Company on behalf of the Participant, will, unless the Restricted 
          Shares are forfeited sooner, lapse upon the earlier of:

          (i)  expiration of the Restriction Period; or

          (ii) the termination of the Participant's employment due to 
               Illness or under Section 11(a), 11(b), or 11(d) of his 
               Employment Agreement with the Company dated February 11, 
               1994, as amended through March 1, 1997 (the "Employment 
               Agreement").


4.   Termination of Employment.  Subject to Section 3(e) above, if the 
     Participant's employment terminates pursuant to Section 11(c) or 11(e) 
     of the Employment Agreement at any time before the Restriction Period 
     ends, the Participant shall immediately forfeit all of the Restricted 
     Shares then held on his behalf by the Company.


5.   Issuance of Shares of Common Stock.  Upon the lapse of the Restriction 
     Period, the Company shall, unless the Restricted Shares are sooner 
     forfeited, promptly deliver to the Participant a stock certificate, 
     free of any restrictions including those set forth in Section 3(d) 
     above.  Subject to any shares that are withheld pursuant to Section 6 
     below, the certificate shall be for that number of shares of Common 
     Stock which, by virtue of the lapse of such Restriction Period, are no 
     longer subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(d).


6.   Withholding.  The Company shall deduct from the Restricted Shares the 
     amount of all applicable income and employment taxes required to be 
     withheld unless the Participant makes other arrangements with the 
     Company for the timely payment of such taxes.


7.   Definitions.

     (a)  Any defined term used in this Award Notice, other than that set 
          forth in Section 7(b) below, shall have the same meaning for 
          purposes of this document as that ascribed to it under the terms 
          of the Plan.

     (b)  The following definition shall apply to this Award Notice:

          (i)  Illness.  A termination of employment will be for "Illness" 
               if the Participant voluntarily terminates his employment 
               following a continuous period of at least 90 days during 
<PAGE>
                                                               <PAGE> 154

               which the Participant is unable to perform the regularly 
               assigned duties and responsibilities of his position with 
               the Company due to illness, disease or injury and the 
               condition is verified by such examinations and/or tests, 
               performed by a mutually agreeable doctor; provided, however, 
               that the Company may, if it reasonably so determines, 
               request additional examinations and/or tests by mutually 
               agreeable doctor(s).


8.   Effect of Award Notice.  This Award Notice, including its reference to 
     the Plan, constitutes the entire understanding between the Company and 
     the Participant concerning the Award and supersedes any prior notices, 
     letters, statements or other documents issued by the Company relating 
     to the Award and all prior agreements and understandings between the 
     Company and the Participant, whether written or oral, concerning the 
     Award.


9.   Administration.  The Committee shall have full and absolute authority 
     and discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan, to interpret, 
     construe and implement this Award Notice, to prescribe, amend and 
     rescind rules and regulations relating to it, and to make all other 
     determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for its 
     administration.  All such Committee determinations shall be final, 
     conclusive and binding upon any and all interested parties and their 
     heirs, successors, and personal representatives.


10.  Impact on Benefits.  The Restricted Shares (either at the date of 
     their grant or at the time their restrictions lapse) shall not be 
     includible as compensation or earnings for purposes of any other 
     compensation or benefit plan offered by the Company.


11.  Miscellaneous.

     (a)  Headings.  The headings of the Sections of the Award Notice have 
          been prepared for convenience and reference only and shall not 
          control, affect the meaning, or be taken as the interpretation of 
          any provision of the Award Notice.

     (b)  Applicable Law.  The Award Notice, including its reference to the 
          Plan, and its interpretation and application, will be governed 
          and controlled by the laws of the State of New York, except as 
          superseded by applicable Federal Law.

     (c)  Amendment.  The Committee may, from time to time, amend this 
          Award Notice in any manner; provided, however, that any such 
          amendment which is adverse to the Participant shall require the 
          Participant's consent.

                                               Executive Compensation and
                                               Development Committee







(1)  Actual size of the grant of nonqualified stock option shall be reduced 
     by the number of shares that shall be granted concurrently under a 
     stock option intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under 
     Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Such option grant shall be 
     in substantially the same form as this grant except to the extent 
     necessary to constitute an incentive stock option under Section 422.

(2)  Recognizing that the maximum number of options that may be granted to 
     a single participant under the 1995 Omnibus Plan in given year is 
     200,000, some of the options will have to be granted under the terms 
     of the 1997 Stock Option Plan.  Given this, the 1997 Stock Option Plan 
     will have to be amended by the Compensation Committee to increase the 
     number of available shares.  Any options granted under the 1997 Stock 
     Option Plan will be granted in substantially the same form as this 
     grant.

              NOTICE OF AWARD OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS
                       GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS
                         EFFECTIVE MARCH   , 1997
                              PURSUANT TO THE
               EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1995 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM
                            COMPENSATION PLAN


1.   Background.  Under Article 8 of the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term 
     Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), the Committee may, among other things, 
     award non-qualified stock options of the Company's Common Stock to 
     those Key Employees as the Committee in its discretion may determine, 
     subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as it deems 
     appropriate.


2.   Award.  Effective March   , 1997, (the "Grant Date"), the Committee 
     granted to Harry L. Kavetas (the "Participant") an award of two 
     hundred thousand (200,000) non-qualified stock options (the "Award").  
     One option provides for the ability to purchase a single share of 
     Common Stock.  The Award is granted under the Plan, subject to the 
     terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth in this Notice of 
     Award of Non-Qualified Stock Options ("Award Notice").


3.   Terms and Conditions of Award.  The following terms and conditions 
     shall apply to the Award:

     (a)  Option Price.  The option price for the options evidenced by way 
          of this Award Notice shall be $    .

     (b)  Duration of Option.  Subject to Section 3(i) below, each option 
          shall expire at the close of business on the tenth anniversary of 
          the Grant Date, unless sooner terminated or forfeited in 
          accordance with the terms and conditions of this Award Notice or 
          the Plan.

     (c)  Vesting.  No option shall be exercisable prior to the date on 
          which it vests.  Twenty five percent (25%) of the options shall 
          vest, on a cumulative basis, on each of the first 4 anniversaries 
          of the Grant Date.  Once vested, the options may be exercised by 
          written notice to the Committee stating the number of options to 
          be exercised.

     (d)  Payment of Option Price.  The option price for the share for 
          which an option is exercised by the  Participant shall be paid by 
          the Participant on the date the option is exercised in cash, in  
          shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant, or a combination 
          of the foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment 
          of the option price shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on 
          the date of exercise.

     (e)  Withholding.  The Participant shall pay the amount of taxes 
          required to be withheld upon exercise of his options by 
          delivering a check made payable to the Company.

     (f)  Rights as a Shareholder.  The Participant shall not have any of 
          the rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common 
          Stock covered by an option except to the extent one or more 
          certificates for such shares shall be delivered to him upon the 
          exercise of such option.

     (g)  Broker Assisted Exercise.  Notwithstanding Sections 3(d) and 3(e) 
          above, the Participant may, subject to Section 5(a) hereof, 
          exercise any option granted to him under this Award Notice by way 
          of the Company's broker-assisted stock option exercise program, 
          to the extent such program is available at the time of such 
          exercise.  Pursuant to the terms of such program, the amount of 
          any taxes required to be withheld upon exercise of any options 
          must be paid in cash directly to the Company.

     (h)  Termination of Employment.  If the Participant's employment 
          terminates due to death, Disability, Illness, Retirement after 
          February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved Reason, the 
          options shall immediately become exercisable and vested in full 
          and shall continue to be exercisable until their scheduled 
          expiration date under Section 3(b) above or, if sooner, their 
          exercise in full.  If the Participant's employment terminates for 
          any reason other than due to death, Disability, Illness, 
          Retirement after February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved 
          Reason, any options which are vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall not be exercisable beyond the 
          60th day following the date of the Participant's termination of 
          employment and any options not vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall be immediately forfeited.

     (i)  Exercise Upon Expiration.  

          (i)  Notwithstanding Section 3(b) hereof to the contrary, if on 
               the options' scheduled expiration date (A) any options 
               remain unexercised and (B) the Fair Market Value of a share 
               of Common Stock exceeds the option price, then the 
               provisions of Section 3(i)(ii) below shall apply.

          (ii) The Participant may exercise any of his unexercised options 
               as of the date they are scheduled to expire, unless already 
               forfeited under the terms and conditions of this Award 
               Notice or the Plan, by providing written notice thereof to 
               the Committee within sixty (60) days after such scheduled 
               expiration date.  In such event, such options shall, for 
               purposes of this Award Notice and the Plan, be treated as 
               exercised prior to the close of business on their scheduled 
               expiration date; provided, however, the Participant shall 
               not be the record owner of the shares acquired upon exercise 
               of such options until the one or more certificates for the 
               shares have been delivered to the Participant.  The strike 
               price of any options issued pursuant to the provisions of 
               this Section 3(i) shall be the mean between the high and low 
               at which the Common Stock trades on the New York Stock 
               Exchange on the options' scheduled expiration date, or, if 
               such day is not a trading day, the immediately preceding 
               trading day.

          (iii) Notwithstanding Section 3(g) above to the contrary, any
               options exercised pursuant to this Section 3(i) shall not, 
               without the Committee's prior approval, be exercised by way 
               of the Company's broker-assisted stock option program.


4.   Definitions.

          forth in Section 4(b) below, shall have the same meaning for

               date, then the opening price on the immediately preceding 
               date on which the Common Stock is traded shall be used.

               assigned duties and responsibilities of his position with 
               the Company due to illness, disease or injury and the 
               condition is verified by such examinations and/or tests, 
               performed by a mutually agreeable doctor; provided, however, 
               that the Company may, if it reasonably so determines,

               agreeable doctor(s).

     partners, (ii) by will or under the laws of descent and distribution, 
     or (iii), on the Participant's death, to a beneficiary designated in

     Shares").  This Award is granted under the Plan, subject to the terms 
     and conditions of the Plan and those set forth in this Notice of Award 
     of Restricted Stock ("Award Notice").


3.   Terms and Conditions of Restricted Shares.  The following terms and 
     conditions shall apply to the Restricted Shares:

     (a)  Issuance.  The Restricted Shares awarded hereunder to the 
          Participant shall be promptly issued and a certificate(s) for 
          such shares shall be issued in the Participant's name.  The 
          Participant shall thereupon be a shareowner of all the shares 
          represented by the certificate(s).  As such, the Participant 
          shall have all the rights of a shareowner with respect to such 
          shares, including but not limited to, the right to vote such 
          shares and to receive all dividends and other distributions 
          (subject to Section 3(b)) paid with respect to them, provided, 
          however, that the shares shall be subject to the restrictions in 
          Section 3(d).  The stock certificates representing the Restricted 
          Shares shall be imprinted with a legend stating that the shares 
          represented thereby are restricted shares subject to the terms 
          and conditions of this Award Notice and, as such, may not be 
          sold, exchanged, transferred, assigned, pledged, hypothecated, or 
          otherwise disposed of except in accordance with this Award 
          Notice.  Each transfer agent for the Common Stock shall be 
          instructed to like effect in respect of such shares.  In aid of 
          such restrictions, the Participant shall immediately upon receipt 
          of the certificate(s) therefor, deposit such certificate(s) 
          together with a stock power or other like instrument of transfer, 
          appropriately endorsed in blank, with the Company.

     (b)  Stock Splits, Dividends, etc.  If under Section 6.2 of the Plan, 
          entitled "Adjustment to Shares," the Participant, as the owner of 
          the Restricted Shares, shall be entitled to new, additional, or 
          different shares of stock or securities, the certificate or 
          certificates for, or other evidences of, such new, additional, or 
          different shares or securities, together with a stock power or 
          other instrument of transfer appropriately endorsed in blank, 
          shall be imprinted with a legend as provided in Section 3(a) 
          above, deposited by the Participant with the Company as provided 
          for therein, and subject to the restrictions provided for in 
          Section 3(d) below.

     (c)  Restriction Period.  The "Restriction Period" for the Restricted 
          Shares shall begin on the Grant Date and terminate, subject to 
          Section 4 below, on February 10, 2001.

     (d)  Restrictions on Restricted Shares.  The restrictions to which the 
          Restricted Shares are subject are:

          (i)  Nonalienation.  During the Restriction Period, the 
               Restricted Shares shall not be sold, exchanged, transferred, 
               assigned, pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise disposed of 
               except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any 
               attempt by the Participant to dispose of a Restricted Share 
               in any such manner shall result in the immediate forfeiture 
               of such share and any other Restricted Shares then held by 
               the Company on the Participant's behalf.

          (ii) Continuous Employment.  Except as set forth in Section 4
               below, if the Participant's employment is terminated for any 
               reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, before the 
               Restriction Period ends, he shall immediately forfeit all of 
               the Restricted Shares.

     (e)  Lapse of Restrictions.  The restrictions set forth in Section 
          3(d) above, with respect to the Restricted Shares held by the 
          Company on behalf of the Participant, will, unless the Restricted 
          Shares are forfeited sooner, lapse upon the earlier of:

          (i)  expiration of the Restriction Period; or

          (ii) the termination of the Participant's employment due to 
               Illness or under Section 11(a), 11(b), or 11(d) of his 
               Employment Agreement with the Company dated February 11, 
               1994, as amended through March 3, 1997 (the "Employment 
               Agreement").


4.   Termination of Employment.  Subject to Section 3(e) above, if the 
     Participant's employment terminates pursuant to Section 11(c) or 11(e) 
     of the Employment Agreement at any time before the Restriction Period 
     ends, the Participant shall immediately forfeit all of the Restricted 
     Shares then held on his behalf by the Company.


5.   Issuance of Shares of Common Stock.  Upon the lapse of the Restriction 
     Period, the Company shall, unless the Restricted Shares are sooner 
     forfeited, promptly deliver to the Participant a stock certificate, 
     free of any restrictions including those set forth in Section 3(d) 
     above.  Subject to any shares that are withheld pursuant to Section 6 
     below, the certificate shall be for that number of shares of Common 
     Stock which, by virtue of the lapse of such Restriction Period, are no 
     longer subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 3(d).


6.   Withholding.  The Company shall deduct from the Restricted Shares the 
     amount of all applicable income and employment taxes required to be 
     withheld unless the Participant makes other arrangements with the 
     Company for the timely payment of such taxes.


7.   Definitions.

     (a)  Any defined term used in this Award Notice, other than that set 
          forth in Section 7(b) below, shall have the same meaning for 
          purposes of this document as that ascribed to it under the terms 
          of the Plan.

     (b)  The following definition shall apply to this Award Notice:

          (i)  Illness.  A termination of employment will be for "Illness" 
               if the Participant voluntarily terminates his employment 
               following a continuous period of at least 90 days during 
               which the Participant is unable to perform the regularly 
               assigned duties and responsibilities of his position with 
               the Company due to illness, disease or injury and the 
               condition is verified by such examinations and/or tests, 
               performed by a mutually agreeable doctor; provided, however, 
               that the Company may, if it reasonably so determines, 
               request additional examinations and/or tests by mutually 
               agreeable doctor(s).

8.   Effect of Award Notice.  This Award Notice, including its reference to 
     the Plan, constitutes the entire understanding between the Company and 
     the Participant concerning the Award and supersedes any prior notices, 
     letters, statements or other documents issued by the Company relating 
     to the Award and all prior agreements and understandings between the 
     Company and the Participant, whether written or oral, concerning the 
     Award.


9.   Administration.  The Committee shall have full and absolute authority 
     and discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan, to interpret, 
     construe and implement this Award Notice, to prescribe, amend and 
     rescind rules and regulations relating to it, and to make all other 
     determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for its 
     administration.  All such Committee determinations shall be final, 
     conclusive and binding upon any and all interested parties and their 
     heirs, successors, and personal representatives.


10.  Impact on Benefits.  The Restricted Shares (either at the date of 
     their grant or at the time their restrictions lapse) shall not be 
     includible as compensation or earnings for purposes of any other 
     compensation or benefit plan offered by the Company.


11.  Miscellaneous.

     (a)  Headings.  The headings of the Sections of the Award Notice have 
          been prepared for convenience and reference only and shall not 
          control, affect the meaning, or be taken as the interpretation of 
          any provision of the Award Notice.

     (b)  Applicable Law.  The Award Notice, including its reference to the 
          Plan, and its interpretation and application, will be governed 
          and controlled by the laws of the State of New York, except as 
          superseded by applicable Federal Law.

     (c)  Amendment.  The Committee may, from time to time, amend this 
          Award Notice in any manner; provided, however, that any such 
          amendment which is adverse to the Participant shall require the 
          Participant's consent.

                NOTICE OF AWARD OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS
                       GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS
                         EFFECTIVE MARCH 4, 1997
                             PURSUANT TO THE
               EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1995 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM
                            COMPENSATION PLAN

1.   Background.  Under Article 8 of the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term 
     Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), the Committee may, among other things, 
     award incentive stock options of the Company's Common Stock to those 
     Key Employees as the Committee in its discretion may determine, 
     subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as it deems 
     appropriate.


2.   Award.  Effective March 4, 1997, (the "Grant Date"), the Committee 
     granted to Harry L. Kavetas (the "Participant") an award of three 
     thousand three hundred and eighty nine (3,389) incentive stock options 
     (the "Award").  One option provides for the ability to purchase a 
     single share of Common Stock.  The Award is granted under the Plan, 
     subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth in 
     this Notice of Award of Incentive Stock Options ("Award Notice").


3.   Terms and Conditions of Award.  The following terms and conditions 
     shall apply to the Award:

     (a)  Option Price.  The option price for the options evidenced by way 
          of this Award Notice shall be $88.50.

     (b)  Duration of Option.  Subject to Section 3(i) below, each option 
          shall expire at the close of business on the tenth anniversary of 
          the Grant Date, unless sooner terminated or forfeited in 
          accordance with the terms and conditions of this Award Notice or 
          the Plan.

     (c)  Vesting.  No option shall be exercisable prior to the date on 
          which it vests.  Once vested, the options may be exercised by 
          written notice to the Committee stating the number of options to 
          be exercised.  The options shall vest in accordance with the 
          following schedule:

               March 4, 1998          1,129
               March 4, 2000          1,130
               March 4, 2001          1,130

     (d)  Payment of Option Price.  The option price for the share for 
          which an option is exercised by the Participant shall be paid by 
          the Participant on the date the option is exercised in cash, in 
          shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant, or a combination 
          of the foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment 
          of the option price shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on 
          the date of exercise.

     (e)  Withholding.  The Participant shall pay the amount of taxes 
          required to be withheld upon exercise of his options by 
          delivering a check made payable to the Company.

     (f)  Rights as a Shareholder.  The Participant shall not have any of 
          the rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common 
          Stock covered by an option except to the extent one or more 
          certificates for such shares shall be delivered to him upon the 
          exercise of such option.

     (g)  Termination of Employment.  If the Participant's employment 
          terminates due to death, Disability, Illness, Retirement after 
          February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved Reason, the 
          options shall immediately become exercisable and vested in full
<PAGE>
          
          <PAGE> 169


          and shall continue to be exercisable until their scheduled 
          expiration date under Section 3(b) above or, if sooner, their 
          exercise in full.  If the Participant's employment terminates for 
          any reason other than due to death, Disability, Illness, 
          Retirement after February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved 
          Reason, any options which are vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall not be exercisable beyond the 
          60th day following the date of the Participant's termination of 
          employment and any options not vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall be immediately forfeited.

     (h)  Exercise Upon Expiration.  

          (i)  Notwithstanding Section 3(b) hereof to the contrary, if on 
               the options' scheduled expiration date (A) any options 
               remain unexercised and (B) the Fair Market Value of a share 
               of Common Stock exceeds the option price, then the 
               provisions of Section 3(h)(ii) below shall apply.

          (ii) The Participant may exercise any of his unexercised options 
               as of the date they are scheduled to expire, unless already 
               forfeited under the terms and conditions of this Award  
               Notice or the Plan, by providing written notice thereof to 
               the Committee within sixty (60) days after such scheduled 
               expiration date.  In such event, such options shall, for 
               purposes of this Award Notice and the Plan, be treated as 
               exercised prior to the close of business on their scheduled 
               expiration date; provided, however, the Participant shall 
               not be the record owner of the shares acquired upon exercise 
               of such options until the one or more certificates for the 
               shares have been delivered to the Participant.  The strike 
               price of any options issued pursuant to the provisions of 
               this Section 3(h) shall be the mean between the high and low 
               at which the Common Stock trades on the New York Stock 
               Exchange on the options' scheduled expiration date, or, if 
               such day is not a trading day, the immediately preceding 
               trading day.


4.   Definitions.

     (a)  Any defined term used in this Award Notice, other than those set 
          forth in Section 4(b) below, shall have the same meaning for 
          purposes of this document as that ascribed to it under the terms 
          of the Plan.

     (b)  The following definitions shall apply to this Award Notice:

          (i)  Fair Market Value.  The opening price of the Common Stock on 
               the New York Stock Exchange on the relevant date; provided, 
               however, if the Common Stock is not traded on the relevant 
               date, then the opening price on the immediately preceding 
               date on which the Common Stock is traded shall be used.

          (ii) Retirement.  The term "Retirement" shall mean the occurrence 
               of the Participant's retirement as determined in accordance 
               with Section 8 of the Employment Agreement between the 
               Participant and the Company dated February 11, 1994, as 
               amended through March 3, 1997 (the "Employment Agreement").

          (iii) Illness.  A termination of employment will be for "Illness"
               if the Participant voluntarily terminates his employment 
               following a continuous period of at least 90 days during 
               which the Participant is unable to perform the regularly 
               assigned duties and responsibilities of his position with 
               the Company due to illness, disease or injury and the 
               condition is verified by such examinations and/or tests, 
               performed by a mutually agreeable doctor; provided, however, 
               that the Company may, if it reasonably so determines, 
               request additional examinations and/or tests by mutually 
               agreeable doctor(s).

          Exchange.

8.   Miscellaneous.

     (a)  Headings.  The headings of the Sections of this Award Notice have

          the Plan, and its interpretation and application, will be

              NOTICE OF AWARD OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS
                       GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS
                         EFFECTIVE MARCH 4, 1997
                             PURSUANT TO THE
               EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1995 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM
                            COMPENSATION PLAN


1.   Background.  Under Article 8 of the 1995 Omnibus Long-Term 
     Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), the Committee may, among other things, 
     award non-qualified stock options of the Company's Common Stock to 
     those Key Employees as the Committee in its discretion may determine, 
     subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as it deems 
     appropriate.


2.   Award.  Effective March 4, 1997, (the "Grant Date"), the Committee 
     granted to Harry L. Kavetas (the "Participant") an award of one 
     hundred fifty five thousand (155,000) non-qualified stock options (the 
     "Award").  One option provides for the ability to purchase a single 
     share of Common Stock.  The Award is granted under the Plan, subject 
     to the terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth in this 
     Notice of Award of Non-Qualified Stock Options ("Award Notice").


3.   Terms and Conditions of Award.  The following terms and conditions 
     shall apply to the Award:

     (a)  Option Price.  The option price for the options evidenced by way 
          of this Award Notice shall be $88.50.

     (b)  Duration of Option.  Subject to Section 3(i) below, each option 
          shall expire at the close of business on the tenth anniversary of 
          the Grant Date, unless sooner terminated or forfeited in 
          accordance with the terms and conditions of this Award Notice or 
          the Plan.

     (c)  Vesting.  No option shall be exercisable prior to the date on 
          which it vests.  Once vested, the options may be exercised by 
          written notice to the Committee stating the number of options to 
          be exercised.  The options shall vest in accordance with the 
          following schedule:

               March 4, 1998            38,469
               March 4, 1999            39,597
               March 4, 2000            38,467
               March 4, 2001            38,467

     (d)  Payment of Option Price.  The option price for the share for 
          which an option is exercised by the Participant shall be paid by 
          the Participant on the date the option is exercised in cash, in 
          shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant, or a combination 
          of the foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment 
          of the option price shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on 
          the date of exercise.

     (e)  Withholding.  The Participant shall pay the amount of taxes 
          required to be withheld upon exercise of his options by 
          delivering a check made payable to the Company.

     (f)  Rights as a Shareholder.  The Participant shall not have any of 
          the rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common 
          Stock covered by an option except to the extent one or more 
          certificates for such shares shall be delivered to him upon the 
          exercise of such option.

     (g)  Broker Assisted Exercise.  Notwithstanding Sections 3(d) and 3(e) 
          above, the Participant may, subject to Section 5(a) hereof, 
          exercise any option granted to him under this Award Notice by way 
          of the Company's broker-assisted stock option exercise program, 
          to the extent such program is available at the time of such 
          exercise.  Pursuant to the terms of such program, the amount of 
          any taxes required to be withheld upon exercise of any options 
          must be paid in cash directly to the Company.

     (h)  Termination of Employment.  If the Participant's employment 
          terminates due to death, Disability, Illness, Retirement after 
          February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved Reason, the 
          options shall immediately become exercisable and vested in full 
          and shall continue to be exercisable until their scheduled 
          expiration date under Section 3(b) above or, if sooner, their 
          exercise in full.  If the Participant's employment terminates for 
          any reason other than due to death, Disability, Illness, 
          Retirement after February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved 
          Reason, any options which are vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall not be exercisable beyond the 
          60th day following the date of the Participant's termination of 
          employment and any options not vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall be immediately forfeited.

     (i)  Exercise Upon Expiration.  

          (i)  Notwithstanding Section 3(b) hereof to the contrary, if on 
               the options' scheduled expiration date (A) any options 
               remain unexercised and (B) the Fair Market Value of a share 
               of Common Stock exceeds the option price, then the 
               provisions of Section 3(i)(ii) below shall apply.

          (ii) The Participant may exercise any of his unexercised options 
               as of the date they are scheduled to expire, unless already 
               forfeited under the terms and conditions of this Award 
               Notice or the Plan, by providing written notice thereof to 
               the Committee within sixty (60) days after such scheduled 
               expiration date.  In such event, such options shall, for 
               purposes of this Award Notice and the Plan, be treated as 
               exercised prior to the close of business on their scheduled 
               expiration date; provided, however, the Participant shall 
               not be the record owner of the shares acquired upon exercise 
               of such options until the one or more certificates for the 
               shares have been delivered to the Participant.  The strike 
               price of any options issued pursuant to the provisions of 
               this Section 3(i) shall be the mean between the high and low 
               at which the Common Stock trades on the New York Stock 
               Exchange on the options' scheduled expiration date, or, if 
               such day is not a trading day, the immediately preceding 
               trading day.

          (iii) Notwithstanding Section 3(g) above to the contrary, any
               options exercised pursuant to this Section 3(i) shall not, 
               without the Committee's prior approval, be exercised by way 
               of the Company's broker-assisted stock option program.

4.   Definitions.

     (a)  Any defined term used in this Award Notice, other than those set 
          forth in Section 4(b) below, shall have the same meaning for 
          purposes of this document as that ascribed to it under the terms 
          of the Plan.

     (b)  The following definitions shall apply to this Award Notice:

          (i)  Fair Market Value.  The opening price of the Common Stock on 
               the New York Stock Exchange on the relevant date; provided, 
               however, if the Common Stock is not traded on the relevant 
               date, then the opening price on the immediately preceding 
               date on which the Common Stock is traded shall be used.

          (ii) Retirement.  The term "Retirement" shall mean the occurrence 
               of the Participant's retirement as determined in accordance 
               with Section 8 of the Employment Agreement between the 
               Participant and the Company dated February 11, 1994, as 
               amended through March 3, 1997 (the "Employment Agreement").

          (iii) Illness.  A termination of employment will be for "Illness"
               if the Participant voluntarily terminates his employment 
               following a continuous period of at least 90 days during 
               which the Participant is unable to perform the regularly 
               assigned duties and responsibilities of his position with 
               the Company due to illness, disease or injury and the 
               condition is verified by such examinations and/or tests, 
               performed by a mutually agreeable doctor; provided, however, 
               that the Company may, if it reasonably so determines, 
               request additional examinations and/or tests by mutually 
               agreeable doctor(s).

          (iv) Approved Reason.  A termination for "Approved Reason" shall 
               include, without limitation, a Termination Without Cause or 
               Constructive Termination without Cause under Section 11(d) 
               of the Employment Agreement.


5.   Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  

     (a)  In order to avoid any Exchange Act violations, the Committee may, 
          at any time and from time to time, impose additional restrictions 
          upon the Awards, including, but not by way of limitation, 
          restrictions regarding the Participant's ability to exercise 
          options under the Company's broker-assisted stock option exercise 
          program under Section 3(g).

     (b)  The Company shall use its best efforts so that on or prior to 
          December 31, 1997, all shares received by the Participant on any 
          exercise of an option shall be, and shall remain, (1) fully 
          registered (at the Company's expense) under the Securities Act of 
          1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), both for issuance and for 
          resale, pursuant to a registration on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act 
          or such successor procedure that provides comparable opportunity 
          under the 1933 Act for issuance and resale; (2) fully registered 
          or qualified (at the Company's expense), under such state 
          securities laws as the Participant may reasonably request, both 
          for issuance and for resale; and (3) listed on the New York Stock 
          Exchange.


6.   Non-Assignability.  These options are non-assignable and 
     non-transferable, in whole or in part, other than (i) by gratuitous 
     transfers to immediate family members, to trusts for their benefit, or 
     to limited partnerships in which immediate family members are the sole 
     partners, (ii) by will or under the laws of descent and distribution, 
     or (iii), on the Participant's death, to a beneficiary designated in 
     writing by the Participant, with any such permitted transferee to 
     succeed to the Participant's rights and obligations under the options 
     to the extent of such transfer.


7.   Effect of Award Notice.  This Award Notice, including its reference to 
     the Plan, constitutes the entire understanding between the Company and 
     the Participant concerning the Award and supersedes any prior notices, 
     letters, statements or other documents issued by the Company relating 
     to the Award and all prior agreements and understandings between the 
     Company and the Participant, whether written or oral, concerning the 
     Award.

8.   Miscellaneous.

     (a)  Headings.  The headings of the Sections of this Award Notice have 
          been prepared for convenience and reference only and shall not 
          control, affect the meaning, or be taken as the interpretation of 
          any provision of the Award Notice.

     (b)  Applicable Law.  This Award Notice, including its reference to 
          the Plan, and its interpretation and application, will be

     (c)  Amendment.  The Committee may, from time to time, amend this 
          Award Notice in any manner; provided, however, that any such 
          amendment which is adverse to the Participant shall require the 
          Participant's consent.


9.   Administration.  The Committee shall have full and absolute authority 
     and discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan, to interpret, 
     construe and implement this Award Notice, to prescribe, amend and

              NOTICE OF AWARD OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS
                       GRANTED TO HARRY L. KAVETAS
                          EFFECTIVE MARCH 4, 1997
                              PURSUANT TO THE
               EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY 1997 STOCK OPTION PLAN


1.   Background.  Under Article 7 of the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the 
     "Plan"), the Committee may, among other things, award non-qualified 
     stock options of Kodak Common Stock to those Key Employees as the 
     Committee in its discretion may determine, subject to such terms, 
     conditions and restrictions as it deems appropriate.


2.   Award.  Effective March 4, 1997, (the "Grant Date"), the Committee 
     granted to Harry L. Kavetas (the "Participant") an award of forty one 
     thousand six hundred and eleven (41,611) non-qualified stock options 
     (the "Award").  One option provides for the ability to purchase a 
     single share of Common Stock.  The Award is granted under the Plan, 
     subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and those set forth in 
     this Notice of Award of Non-Qualified Stock Options ("Award Notice").


3.   Terms and Conditions of Award.  The following terms and conditions 
     shall apply to the Award:

     (a)  Option Price.  The option price for the options evidenced by way 
          of this Award Notice shall be $88.50.

     (b)  Duration of Option.  Subject to Section 3(i) below, each option 
          shall expire at the close of business on the tenth anniversary of 
          the Grant Date, unless sooner terminated or forfeited in 
          accordance with the terms and conditions of this Award Notice or 
          the Plan.

     (c)  Vesting.  No option shall be exercisable prior to the date on 
          which it vests.  Once vested, the options may be exercised by 
          written notice to the Committee stating the number of options to 
          be exercised.  The options shall vest in accordance with the 
          following schedule:

               March 4, 1998          10,402
               March 4, 1999          10,403
               March 4, 2000          10,403
               March 4, 2001          10,403

     (d)  Payment of Option Price.  The option price for the share for 
          which an option is exercised by the Participant shall be paid by 
          the Participant on the date the option is exercised in cash, in 
          shares of Common Stock owned by the Participant, or a combination 
          of the foregoing.  Any share of Common Stock delivered in payment 
          of the option price shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on 
          the date of exercise.

     (e)  Withholding.  The Participant shall pay the amount of taxes 
          required to be withheld upon exercise of his options by 
          delivering a check made payable to Kodak.

     (f)  Rights as a Shareholder.  The Participant shall not have any of 
          the rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common 
          Stock covered by an option except to the extent one or more 
          certificates for such shares shall be delivered to him upon the 
          exercise of such option.

     (g)  Broker Assisted Exercise.  Notwithstanding Sections 3(d) and 3(e) 
          above, the Participant may, subject to Section 5(a) hereof, 
          exercise any option granted to him under this Award Notice by way 
          of Kodak's broker-assisted stock option exercise program, to the 
          extent such program is available at the time of such exercise.  
          Pursuant to the terms of such program, the amount of any taxes 
          required to be withheld upon exercise of any options must be paid 
          in cash directly to Kodak.

     (h)  Termination of Employment.  If the Participant's employment 
          terminates due to death, Disability, Illness, Retirement after 
          February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved Reason, the 
          options shall immediately become exercisable and vested in full 
          and shall continue to be exercisable until their scheduled 
          expiration date under Section 3(b) above or, if sooner, their 
          exercise in full.  If the Participant's employment terminates for 
          any reason other than due to death, Disability, Illness, 
          Retirement after February 11, 2001 or termination for an Approved 
          Reason, any options which are vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall not be exercisable beyond the 
          60th day following the date of the Participant's termination of 
          employment and any options not vested at the time of the 
          Participant's termination shall be immediately forfeited.

     (i)  Exercise Upon Expiration.  

          (i)  Notwithstanding Section 3(b) hereof to the contrary, if on 
               the options' scheduled expiration date (A) any options 
               remain unexercised and (B) the Fair Market Value of a share 
               of Common Stock exceeds the option price, then the 
               provisions of Section 3(i)(ii) below shall apply.

          (ii) The Participant may exercise any of his unexercised options 
               as of the date they are scheduled to expire, unless already 
               forfeited under the terms and conditions of this Award 
               Notice or the Plan, by providing written notice thereof to 
               the Committee within sixty (60) days after such scheduled 
               expiration date.  In such event, such options shall, for 
               purposes of this Award Notice and the Plan, be treated as 
               exercised prior to the close of business on their scheduled 
               expiration date; provided, however, the Participant shall 
               not be the record owner of the shares acquired upon exercise 
               of such options until the one or more certificates for the 
               shares have been delivered to the Participant.  The strike 
               price of any options issued pursuant to the provisions of 
               this Section 3(i) shall be the mean between the high and low 
               at which the Common Stock trades on the New York Stock 
               Exchange on the options' scheduled expiration date, or, if 
               such day is not a trading day, the immediately preceding 
               trading day.

          (iii) Notwithstanding Section 3(g) above to the contrary, any
               options exercised pursuant to this Section 3(i) shall not, 
               without the Committee's prior approval, be exercised by way 
               of Kodak's broker-assisted stock option program.

4.   Definitions.

     (a)  Any defined term used in this Award Notice, other than those set 
          forth in Section 4(b) below, shall have the same meaning for 
          purposes of this document as that ascribed to it under the terms 
          of the Plan.

     (b)  The following definitions shall apply to this Award Notice:

          (i)  Fair Market Value.  The opening price of the Common Stock on 
               the New York Stock Exchange on the relevant date; provided, 
               however, if the Common Stock is not traded on the relevant 
               date, then the opening price on the immediately preceding 
               date on which the Common Stock is traded shall be used.

          (ii) Retirement.  The term "Retirement" shall mean the occurrence 
               of the Participant's retirement as determined in accordance 
               with Section 8 of the Employment Agreement between the 
               Participant and Kodak dated February 11, 1994, as amended 
               through March 3, 1997 (the "Employment Agreement").

          (iii) Illness.  A termination of employment will be for "Illness"
               if the Participant voluntarily terminates his employment 
               following a continuous period of at least 90 days during 
               which the Participant is unable to perform the regularly 
               assigned duties and responsibilities of his position with 
               Kodak due to illness, disease or injury and the condition is 
               verified by such examinations and/or tests, performed by a 
               mutually agreeable doctor; provided, however, that Kodak 
               may, if it reasonably so determines, request additional 
               examinations and/or tests by mutually agreeable doctor(s).

          (iv) Approved Reason.  A termination for "Approved Reason" shall 
               include, without limitation, a Termination Without Cause or 
               Constructive Termination without Cause under Section 11(d) 
               of the Employment Agreement.


5.   Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  

     (a)  In order to avoid any Exchange Act violations, the Committee may, 
          at any time and from time to time, impose additional restrictions 
          upon the Awards, including, but not by way of limitation, 
          restrictions regarding the Participant's ability to exercise 
          options under Kodak's broker-assisted stock option exercise 
          program under Section 3(g).

     (b)  Kodak shall use its best efforts so that on or prior to December 
          31, 1997, all shares received by the Participant on any exercise 
          of an option shall be, and shall remain, (1) fully registered (at 
          Kodak's expense) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
          (the "1933 Act"), both for issuance and for resale, pursuant to a 
          registration on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act or such successor 
          procedure that provides comparable opportunity under the 1933 Act 
          for issuance and resale; (2) fully registered or qualified (at 
          Kodak's expense), under such state securities laws as the 
          Participant may reasonably request, both for issuance and for 
          resale; and (3) listed on the New York Stock Exchange.


6.   Non-Assignability.  These options are non-assignable and 
     non-transferable, in whole or in part, other than (i) by gratuitous 
     transfers to immediate family members, to trusts for their benefit, or 
     to limited partnerships in which immediate family members are the sole 
     partners, (ii) by will or under the laws of descent and distribution, 
     or (iii), on the Participant's death, to a beneficiary designated in 
     writing by the Participant, with any such permitted transferee to 
     succeed to the Participant's rights and obligations under the options 
     to the extent of such transfer.


7.   Effect of Award Notice.  This Award Notice, including its reference to 
     the Plan, constitutes the entire understanding between Kodak and the 
     Participant concerning the Award and supersedes any prior notices, 
     letters, statements or other documents issued by Kodak relating to the 
     Award and all prior agreements and understandings between Kodak and 
     the Participant, whether written or oral, concerning the Award.

8.   Miscellaneous.

     (a)  Headings.  The headings of the Sections of this Award Notice have 
          been prepared for convenience and reference only and shall not 
          control, affect the meaning, or be taken as the interpretation of 
          any provision of the Award Notice.

     (b)  Applicable Law.  This Award Notice, including its reference to 
          the Plan, and its interpretation and application, will be 
          governed and controlled by the laws of the State of New York, 
          except as superseded by applicable Federal Law.

     (c)  Amendment.  The Committee may, from time to time, amend this 
          Award Notice in any manner; provided, however, that any such 
          amendment which is adverse to the Participant shall require the 
          Participant's consent.

9.   Administration.  The Committee shall have full and absolute authority
