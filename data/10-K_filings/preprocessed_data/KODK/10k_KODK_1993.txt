In addition Companys product development effort focused digital capture device digital camera scanner designed improve image acquisition digitalization process software product designed enhance simplify digital workflow output device thermal inkjet printer commercial printing system solution consumables designed produce high quality document image medium thermal silver halide optimized digital workflow . Kodaks success depends part ability develop introduce new product service timely manner keep pace technological development accepted market . The Company continues introduce new consumer commercial digital product offering . However assurance Company successful anticipating developing new product product enhancement new solution service adequately address changing technology customer requirement . In addition Company unable anticipate develop improvement current technology adapt product changing customer preference requirement continue produce high quality product timely costeffective manner order compete product offered competitor could adversely affect revenue Company . If continue license enforce intellectual property right business depends third party assert violate intellectual property right revenue earnings expense may adversely impacted . Kodak relies upon patent copyright trademark trade secret law United States similar law country agreement employee customer supplier party establish maintain enforce intellectual property right . Any Companys direct indirect intellectual property right could however challenged invalidated circumvented intellectual property right may sufficient permit Company take advantage current market trend otherwise provide competitive advantage could result costly product redesign effort discontinuance certain product offering competitive harm . Further law certain country protect proprietary right extent law United States . Therefore certain jurisdiction Kodak may unable protect proprietary technology adequately unauthorized third party copying use could adversely affect competitive position . Also rapid pace technological change information technology industry much business many product rely key technology developed licensed third party may able obtain continue obtain license technology third party reasonable term . Kodak made substantial investment new proprietary technology filed patent application obtained patent protect intellectual property right technology well interest Companys licensee . The execution enforcement licensing agreement protects Companys intellectual property right provides revenue stream form royalty enables Kodak innovate provide marketplace new product service . There assurance measure alone adequate protect Companys intellectual property . The Companys ability execute intellectual property licensing strategy could also affect Companys revenue earnings . Kodaks failure develop properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect Companys market position business opportunity . Furthermore Companys failure identify implement licensing program including identifying appropriate licensee could adversely affect profitability Kodaks operation . 12 Finally third party may claim Company customer indemnified Kodak infringing upon intellectual property right . Such claim may made competitor seeking block limit Kodaks access digital market . Additionally recent year individual group begun purchasing intellectual property asset sole purpose making claim infringement attempting extract settlement large company like Kodak . Even Kodak belief claim without merit claim timeconsuming costly defend distract management attention resource . Claims intellectual property infringement also might require Company redesign affected product enter costly settlement license agreement pay costly damage award face temporary permanent injunction prohibiting Kodak marketing selling certain product . Even Company agreement indemnify cost indemnifying party may unable uphold contractual agreement Kodak . If license infringed technology license technology reasonable term substitute similar technology another source revenue earnings could adversely impacted . If attract retain motivate key employee business could harmed . In order Company successful must continue attract retain motivate executive key employee including technical managerial marketing sale research support position . Hiring retaining qualified executive research professional qualified sale representative critical Companys future . Competition experienced employee industry compete intense . The market employee digital skill highly competitive therefore Companys ability attract talent depend number factor including compensation benefit work location persuading potential employee Company wellpositioned success digital market Kodak entering . Given Companys compensation plan highly performancebased given impact global economy Companys performance may become challenging retain key employee . The risk may mitigated fact many company recently taking action limit reduce compensation benefit light difficult economy . The Company also must keep employee focused strategic initiative goal order successful . If attract properly qualified individual retain key executive employee motivate employee business could harmed . System integration issue could adversely affect revenue earnings . Portions IT infrastructure may experience interruption delay cessation service connection system integration migration work take place time time particular installation SAP within Graphic Communications Group . We may successful implementing new system transitioning data could cause business disruption expensive time consuming disruptive resourceintensive .

If Company fail successfully execute plan within timing current restructuring program align cost structure current economic reality Companys financial performance could adversely affected . We outsourced significant portion overall worldwide manufacturing backoffice operation face risk associated relying third party manufacturer external supplier . We outsourced significant portion overall worldwide manufacturing customer support administrative operation credit collection general ledger accounting function third party various service provider . To extent rely third party manufacturing relationship face risk manufacturer may able 1 develop manufacturing method appropriate product 2 maintain adequate control environment 3 quickly respond change customer demand product 4 obtain supply material necessary manufacturing process 5 mitigate impact labor shortage andor disruption . As result risk Kodaks manufacturing cost could higher planned reliability product could decline . Other supplier problem Kodak could face include component shortage excess supply risk related term contract supplier risk related dependency single source supplier . If risk realized assuming alternative thirdparty manufacturing relationship could established could experience interruption supply increase cost might result unable meet customer demand product damage relationship customer reduced market share could adversely affect result operation financial condition . The competitive pressure face could harm revenue gross margin market share . The market business highly competitive encounter aggressive price competition product service numerous company globally . Over past several year price competition market digital product film service particularly intense competitor aggressively cut price lowered profit margin product . In Graphic Communications Group segment aggressive pricing tactic competitor intensified contract negotiation process . Our result operation financial condition may adversely affected industrywide pricing pressure . If Company unable obtain pricing program sufficiently competitive current future competitor Kodak could also lose market share adversely affecting revenue gross margin . If fail manage distribution product service properly revenue gross margin earnings could adversely impacted . The Company us variety different distribution method sell product service including thirdparty resellers distributor direct indirect sale enterprise account customer . Successfully managing interaction direct indirect channel various potential customer segment product service complex process . Moreover since distribution method distinct risk cost failure implement advantageous balance delivery model product service could adversely affect revenue gross margin earnings . Due change Companys gotomarket model Company reliant fewer distributor . This concentrated Companys credit risk appropriately managed could result adverse impact Companys financial performance . We may provide financing financial guarantee customer may significant amount . The competitive environment operate may require u provide financing customer order win contract . Customer financing arrangement may include portion purchase price product service . We may also assist customer obtaining financing bank source may provide financial guarantee behalf customer . Our success may dependent part upon ability provide customer financing competitive term customer creditworthiness . As noted previously recent tightening credit global financial market could adversely affect 14 ability customer obtain financing significant purchase could result decrease cancellation order product service . If unable provide competitive financing arrangement customer extend credit customer whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact revenue profitability financial position . Due nature product sell worldwide distribution subject change currency exchange rate interest rate commodity cost may adversely impact result operation financial position . Kodak result global operating financing activity exposed change currency exchange rate interest rate may adversely affect result operation financial position . Exchange rate interest rate certain market Company business tend volatile . In addition Kodaks product contain silver aluminum petroleumbased commoditybased raw material cost volatile . There guarantee global economic situation worsen creating volatility currency exchange rate interest rate commodity price could future negative effect revenue earnings . If protect reputation due product quality liability issue business could harmed . Kodak product becoming increasingly sophisticated complicated design build rapid advancement technology occur . Although Kodak established internal procedure minimize risk may arise product quality liability issue assurance Kodak able eliminate mitigate occurrence issue associated damage . Kodak may incur expense connection example product recall service lawsuit Kodaks brand image reputation producer highquality product could suffer . Business disruption could seriously harm future revenue financial condition increase cost expense . Our worldwide operation could subject earthquake power shortage telecommunication failure water shortage tsunami flood hurricane typhoon fire extreme weather condition medical epidemic natural manmade disaster business interruption predominantly selfinsured . The occurrence business disruption could seriously harm revenue financial condition increase cost expense . In addition area including part east west coast United States previously experienced may experience future major power shortage blackout . These blackout could cause disruption operation operation supplier distributor resellers customer . These event could seriously harm revenue financial condition increase cost expense . The implementation new legislation regulation change existing law regulation could increase Companys cost comply consequently reduce profitability . New business legislation regulation change existing law regulation including interpretation existing regulation court regulator could adversely affect Kodaks result operation increasing Companys cost comply . For example tax labor environmental security law regulation may enacted future require Company adopt new policy internal control compliance practice modify existing production facility operation . Each compliance initiative could lead internal external cost increase . The Company may required recognize additional impairment value goodwill would increase expense reduce profitability . Goodwill represents excess amount paid acquire business fair value net asset date acquisition . The Company test goodwill impairment annually whenever event occur circumstance change would likely reduce fair value reporting unit carrying amount . This may occur various reason including change actual expected income cash flow reporting unit . In fourth quarter 2008 recorded pretax noncash charge 785 million writeoff 15 significant portion goodwill balance within GCG segment . We continue evaluate current market condition may affect fair value reporting unit ass whether goodwill impairment exists future . Continued adverse worsening market condition certain business may significant impact fair value reporting unit could result additional future impairment goodwill . ITEM 1B .
