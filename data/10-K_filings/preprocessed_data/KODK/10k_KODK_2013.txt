Regulators worldwide exercising heightened scrutiny respect anticorruption economic trade sanction antimoney laundering law regulation . Such heightened scrutiny resulted aggressive investigation enforcement law burdensome regulation could adversely impact Kodaks business . Kodak global operating presence including numerous developing economy company government official likely engage business practice prohibited domestic foreign law regulation including United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act U.K . Bribery Act . Such law generally prohibit improper payment offer payment foreign government official leader political party case person purpose obtaining retaining business . Kodak also subject economic trade sanction program including administered U.S. Treasury Departments Office Foreign Assets Control prohibit restrict transaction dealing specified country government certain circumstance national individual entity specially designated including narcotic trafficker terrorist terrorist organization among others . In addition Kodak subject antimoney laundering law regulation . Kodak implemented policy procedure monitor address compliance applicable anticorruption economic trade sanction antimoney laundering law regulation continuously process reviewing upgrading enhancing certain policy procedure . However assurance employee consultant agent take action violation policy may ultimately responsible policy procedure adequate determined adequate regulator . Any violation applicable anticorruption economic trade sanction antimoney laundering law regulation could limit certain Kodaks business activity satisfactorily remediated could result civil criminal penalty including fine could damage reputation materially adverse effect result operation financial condition . Failure comply privacy data protection cyber security law regulation could materially adverse effect Kodaks reputation result operation financial condition . Kodak receives process transmits store information relating identifiable individual personal information role technology provider employer . As result Kodak subject numerous U.S. federal state foreign law regulation relating personal information . These law subject frequent change new legislation area may enacted time . In Europe General Data Protection Regulation GDPR became effective May 25 2018 European Union EU member state . The GDPR includes operational requirement company receiving processing personal data EU resident partially different previously place includes significant penalty noncompliance . This change well change existing law introduction new law area failure comply existing law applicable may subject Kodak among thing additional cost change business practice liability monetary damage fine andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity restriction ability obtain process information allegation customer client performed contractual obligation . At time risk cyberattacks relevant requirement regarding storage transfer sharing handling personal information . This environment demand Kodak continuously improve design coordination security control contractual arrangement across business geography . Despite effort possible security control personal data training employee vendor data privacy data security practice follows may prevent improper disclosure personal information . Improper disclosure information could harm reputation subject liability law protect personal data resulting increased cost loss revenue . 14 If Kodak protect intellectual property right business depends third party assert violates intellectual property right revenue earnings expense liquidity may adversely impacted . A key differentiator Kodak many business technological advantage competitor product solution . Its technological advantage supported Kodaks intellectual property right . Patent copyright trademark trade secret law United States similar law country nondisclosure confidentiality type agreement Kodaks employee customer supplier party may effective establishing maintaining protecting enforcing Kodaks intellectual property right . Any Kodaks direct indirect intellectual property right could challenged invalidated circumvented infringed diluted disclosed misappropriated intellectual property right may sufficient permit take advantage current market trend otherwise provide competitive advantage could result costly product redesign effort discontinuance certain product offering competitive harm . Further law certain country protect proprietary right degree law United States . Therefore certain jurisdiction Kodak may unable protect proprietary technology adequately unauthorized third party copying infringement use could adversely affect competitive position . Also much Kodaks business many product rely key technology developed licensed third party rapid pace technological change information technology industry may able obtain continue obtain license technology relevant third party reasonable term . Kodak also license third party use trademark . In effort preserve trademark right Kodak enters license agreement third party govern use trademark require licensee abide quality control standard respect good service provide trademark . Although Kodak make effort police use trademark licensee assurance effort sufficient ensure licensee abide term license . In event Kodaks licensee fail trademark right could diluted reputation harmed licensee activity . Also failure Kodak licensee sufficiently exploit Kodaks trademark market could erode Kodaks trademark right respect relevant trademark . Because law enforcement regime certain country protect proprietary right degree United States certain jurisdiction Kodak may unable adequately prevent unauthorized us could result impairment trademark right . Kodak made substantial investment new proprietary technology filed patent application obtained patent protect intellectual property right technology well interest licensee . There assurance Kodaks patent application approved patent issued sufficient scope strength provide meaningful protection patent challenged third party . Furthermore Kodak may fail accurately predict country patent protection ultimately desirable fails timely file patent application country may precluded later date . The patent issuing may vary scope coverage depending country patent issue . In addition intellectual property right others could inhibit Kodaks ability conduct business . Other company may hold patent technology used Kodaks industry company aggressively seeking expand enforce license patent portfolio . Third party may claim Kodak customer licensee party indemnified infringing upon intellectual property right . Such claim may made competitor seeking block limit Kodaks access certain market . Additionally recent year individual group begun purchasing intellectual property asset sole purpose making claim infringement attempting extract settlement large company like Kodak . Even belief claim without merit claim may following negative impact business claim time consuming costly defend may distract management attention resource claim intellectual property infringement may require redesign affected product enter costly settlement license agreement pay costly damage award face temporary permanent injunction prohibiting marketing selling certain product even agreement third party indemnify cost indemnifying party may unable uphold party contractual obligation license infringed technology license technology reasonable term substitute similar technology another source revenue earnings could adversely impacted . Finally Kodak us open source software connection product service . Companies incorporate open source software product time time faced claim challenging ownership open source software andor compliance open source license term . As result Kodak could subject suit party claiming ownership belief open source software noncompliance open source licensing term . Some open source software license require user distribute open source software part software publicly disclose part source code software andor make available derivative work open source code unfavorable term cost . Any requirement disclose Kodaks source code pay damage breach contract could harmful business result operation financial condition . Kodaks future pension postretirement benefit plan cost required level contribution could unfavorably impacted change actuarial assumption market performance plan asset obligation imposed legislation pension authority could adversely affect financial position result operation cash flow . 15 Kodak significant defined benefit pension postretirement benefit obligation . The funded status U.S. nonU.S . defined benefit pension plan postretirement benefit plan related cost reflected financial statement affected various factor subject inherent degree uncertainty . Key assumption used value benefit obligation funded status expense recognition include discount rate future payment obligation long term expected rate return plan asset salary growth healthcare cost trend rate mortality trend economic demographic factor . Significant difference actual experience significant change future assumption obligation imposed legislation pension authority could lead potential future need contribute cash asset Kodaks plan excess currently estimated contribution benefit payment could adverse effect Kodaks consolidated result operation financial position liquidity . In past year Kodak experienced increase cost defined benefit pension postretirement benefit obligation result macroeconomic factor beyond control including increase health care cost decline investment return pension plan asset change discount rate mortality rate used calculate pension related liability . At least macroeconomic factor may put pressure cost providing pension medical benefit . There assurance succeed limiting cost increase . In addition continued upward pressure including result new legislation could reduce profitability business . Kodak may required recognize impairment value goodwill andor longlived asset could adversely affect result operation . Upon emergence bankruptcy Kodak applied fresh start accounting pursuant reorganization value allocated individual asset liability based estimated fair value . The excess reorganization value fair value identified tangible intangible asset reported goodwill . In connection fresh start Kodak also determined fair value longlived asset including intangible asset . The determination reorganization value equity value Companys common stock fair value asset liability dependent various estimate assumption including financial projection realization certain event . Kodak test goodwill indefinite lived intangible asset impairment annually whenever event occur circumstance change would likely reduce fair value reporting unit carrying amount . Kodak evaluates longlived asset impairment whenever event change circumstance indicate carrying value may recoverable . Impairments could occur future Kodaks expected future cash flow decline market interest rate environment deteriorate carrying value change materially compared change respective fair value . Kodaks business experience seasonality sale . Therefore lower demand Kodaks product increase cost period expected peak seasonality may pronounced negative effect result operation . Equipment consumables sale generally exhibit higher level fourth quarter due seasonal nature placement resulting customer industry budgeting practice . As result sequential quartertoquarter comparison good indication Kodaks performance perform future . In addition adverse development expected peak period seasonality lowerthananticipated demand product internal system failure increase material cost failure performance problem one key logistics component supply manufacturing partner could material adverse impact financial condition operating result . Tight credit market limit capital investment weak economy decrease print demand could negatively impact equipment consumable sale . These external development often unpredictable may adverse impact business result operation . If Kodak fails manage distribution product service properly revenue gross margin earnings could adversely impacted . Kodak us variety different distribution method sell deliver product service including thirdparty resellers distributor direct indirect sale enterprise account customer . Successfully managing interaction direct indirect channel various potential customer segment product service complex process . Moreover since distribution method distinct risk cost Kodaks failure achieve advantageous balance delivery model product service could adversely affect revenue gross margin earnings . This concentrated Kodaks credit operational risk could result adverse impact financial performance . Kodaks future result could harmed unsuccessful sale emerging market . Because Kodak seeking expand sale number customer relationship outside United States including emerging market Asia Latin America Eastern Europe Kodaks business subject risk associated business internationally support multiple language recruitment sale technical support personnel skill design manufacture sell supply product compliance governmental regulation import export including obtaining required import export approval product complexity managing international operation exposure foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 16 commercial law business practice may favor local competition imposition tariff product raw material imported exported U.S. multiple potentially conflicting changing governmental law regulation practice including differing export import tax anticorruption antidumping economic sanction labor employment law difficulty collecting account receivable limitation restriction repatriation cash limitation reduction protection intellectual property right complication logistics distribution arrangement political economic instability . There assurance Kodak able market sell product targeted market . If effort successful business growth result operation could harmed . As global company Kodak subject regulatory requirement law jurisdiction operates alleged noncompliance requirement law could result adverse financial reputational impact . Kodak subject environmental law regulation failure comply law regulation liability imposed result law regulation could adverse effect business result operation financial condition . Kodak subject environmental law regulation worldwide govern example discharge pollutant management hazardous material cleanup contaminated site composition endoflife management product . Noncompliance applicable law liability incurred without regard fault could material adverse effect business result operation financial condition . The cost complying law could material adverse effect business result operation financial condition . In addition Company New York State Department Environmental Conservation New York Empire State Development Corporation entered settlement agreement concerning certain Companys historical environmental liability Eastman Business Park discharge Genesee River establishment 49 million environmental remediation trust . Should historical liability exceed 49 million New York State responsible payment cost additional 50 million . In event historical liability exceed 99 million Company become liable 50 portion 99 million could material adverse effect financial condition . The settlement agreement implemented May 20 2014 . The settlement agreement includes covenant sue U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . Any uncertainty related Companys environmental obligation may impact ability develop transform Eastman Business Park . Kodak may additional tax liability . Kodak subject income tax U.S. many foreign jurisdiction . Significant judgment required determining Kodaks worldwide provision income tax . In course business transaction calculation ultimate tax determination uncertain . For example compliance Tax Cuts Jobs Act 2017 Tax Act may continue require exercise significant judgment accounting provision . Many aspect 2017 Tax Act unclear may clarified time . As regulation guidance evolve respect 2017 Tax Act Kodak gather information performs analysis Kodaks result may differ previous estimate may materially affect financial position . Kodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdiction worldwide subject audit jurisdiction . These audit involve complex issue may require extended period time resolution . Managements ongoing assessment outcome issue related tax position require judgment although management belief adequate provision made issue possibility ultimate resolution issue could adverse effect earnings cash flow Kodak . Kodaks business financial position result operation cash flow reputation may negatively impacted legal matter . Kodak various contingency reflected balance sheet including arising result involved time time variety claim lawsuit investigation remediation proceeding concerning commercial tax tort custom employment health safety intellectual property matter licensee activity compliance various domestic international law regulation . Should development matter cause change determination unfavorable outcome result need recognize material accrual matter result final adverse judgment settled significant amount could material adverse effect business financial position result operation cash flow . 17 Regulations related conflict mineral may require Kodak incur additional expense could limit supply increase cost certain metal used manufacturing Kodaks product . The DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Consumer Protection Act contains provision improve transparency accountability concerning supply mineral originating conflict zone Democratic Republic Congo DRC adjoining country . As result August 2012 SEC adopted rule requiring disclosure related sourcing specified mineral known conflict mineral necessary functionality production product manufactured contracted manufactured public company . Kodak designed overall conflict mineral policy procedure consistent guidance issued Organization Economic Cooperation Development OECD continues perform due diligence supply chain . Kodak filed recent Conflict Minerals Disclosure report reporting period January 1 2017 December 31 2017 May 31 2018 . As date report Kodak determined certain product contain specified mineral unable determine whether mineral originate DRC adjoining country . Kodak may incur additional cost comply disclosure requirement including cost related determining source specified mineral used product addition cost change product process source supply consequence verification activity may adversely affect business . In addition number supplier provide conflictfree mineral may limited may make difficult satisfy customer require component product certified conflictfree could place competitive disadvantage unable . Because Kodaks supply chain complex may also able sufficiently verify origin relevant mineral used product due diligence procedure may harm reputation . Risks Related Companys Indebtedness Access Capital Markets There assurance Company able comply term various credit facility .

Kodak early adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 201704 Intangibles Goodwill Other Topic 350 Simplifying Accounting Goodwill Impairment effective January 1 2017 requires entity calculate goodwill impairment amount reporting unit carrying value exceeds fair value exceed carrying amount goodwill . Determining fair value reporting unit involves use significant estimate assumption . Kodak estimate fair value reporting unit using guideline public company method discounted cash flow method . To estimate fair value utilizing guideline public company method Kodak applies valuation multiple derived operating data publiclytraded benchmark company operating data reporting unit . The valuation multiple based earnings interest tax depreciation amortization EBITDA . To estimate fair value utilizing discounted cash flow method Kodak establishes estimate future cash flow reporting unit discount estimated future cash flow present value . Kodak performed quantitative test impairment reporting unit annual goodwill impairment test December 31 2018 . Kodak utilized discounted cash flow method guideline public company method estimate fair value reporting unit goodwill . For reporting unit Kodak selected equal weighting guideline public company method discounted cash flow method valuation approach produced comparable range fair value . Fair value reporting unit estimated using discounted cash flow method . 29 To estimate fair value utilizing discounted cash flow method Kodak established estimate future cash flow period ranging January 1 2019 December 31 2023 discounted estimated future cash flow present value . The expected cash flow derived earnings forecast assumption regarding growth margin projection applicable . The discount rate estimated based aftertax weighted average cost capital WACC reporting unit reflecting rate return would expected market participant . The WACC also take consideration company specific risk premium reporting unit reflecting risk associated overall uncertainty financial projection . Discount rate 13 55 utilized valuation based Kodaks best estimate aftertax weightedaverage cost capital reporting unit . A terminal value included reporting unit end cash flow projection period reflect remaining value reporting unit expected generate . The terminal value calculated using either constant growth method CGM based cash flow final year discrete period Hmodel assumes growth terminal period start higher rate decline linear manner specified transition period toward stable growth rate . Based upon result Kodaks December 31 2018 analysis Kodak concluded fair value reporting unit substantially exceeded carrying value therefore impairment goodwill indicated . Impairment goodwill could occur future reporting unit fair value change significantly Kodaks market capitalization significantly decline reporting unit carrying value change materially compared change fair value result change operating segment reporting unit . The carrying value indefinitelived intangible asset related Kodak trade name evaluated potential impairment annually whenever event change circumstance indicate likely asset impaired . Kodak performed annual test impairment Kodak trade name December 31 2018 . The fair value Kodak trade name valued using income approach specifically relief royalty method based following significant assumption forecasted revenue ranging January 1 2019 December 31 2023 including terminal year growth rate ranging 2 2.5 b aftertax royalty rate ranging .4 .8 expected net sale determined regard comparable market transaction profitability analysis c discount rate ranging 17 32 based aftertax weightedaverage cost capital Based result Kodaks December 31 2018 assessment carrying value Kodak trade name exceeded fair value Kodak recorded pretax impairment charge 13 million . Impairment Kodak trade name could occur future expected revenue decline significant change discount rate royalty rate . Longlived asset goodwill indefinitelived intangible asset evaluated impairment whenever event change circumstance indicate carrying value may recoverable .

The Fundamental Change Reorganization Conversion value exceeded value embedded conversion feature derivative liability December 31 2018 2017 resulting derivative reported asset . Taxes Kodak recognizes deferred tax liability asset expected future tax consequence operating loss credit carryforwards temporary difference carrying amount tax basis Kodaks asset liability . Kodak record valuation allowance reduce net deferred tax asset amount likely realized . Kodak considered forecasted earnings future taxable income geographical mix earnings jurisdiction Kodak operates prudent feasible tax planning strategy determining need valuation allowance . As December 31 2018 Kodak net deferred tax asset valuation allowance approximately 999 million valuation allowance related net deferred tax asset approximately 853 million resulting net deferred tax asset approximately 146 million . The net deferred tax asset used offset taxable income future period reduce Kodaks income tax payable future period . At time considered likely taxable income future sufficient allow realization net deferred tax asset . However Kodak unable generate sufficient taxable income valuation allowance reduce net deferred tax asset may required could materially increase expense period valuation allowance recognized . Conversely Kodak make determination likely deferred tax asset currently valuation allowance would realized related valuation allowance would reduced benefit earnings would recorded . Kodak considers positive negative evidence determining whether valuation allowance needed territory including limited whether particular entity threeyear cumulative income position . During 2018 2017 Kodak determined likely portion deferred tax asset outside U.S. would realized result increased profit location outside U.S. accordingly recorded benefit 4 million 101 million respectively associated release valuation allowance deferred tax asset . Additionally 2018 Kodak determined likely portion deferred tax asset outside U.S. would realized due reduced sale volume location outside U.S. accordingly recorded provision 15 million associated establishment valuation allowance deferred tax asset . During 2017 Kodak determined likely portion deferred tax asset outside U.S. would realized due reduced manufacturing volume negatively impacting profitability location outside U.S. accordingly recorded provision 7 million associated establishment valuation allowance deferred tax asset . Kodak may able make determination realization deferred tax asset certain foreign jurisdiction likely future . Kodak continue evaluate whether valuation allowance needed jurisdictional level future reporting period . It possible sufficient positive evidence including sustained profitability may become available future period respect one jurisdiction reach conclusion part valuation allowance respect jurisdiction could reversed . Utilization postemergence net operating loss NOL tax credit may subject limitation event significant change stock ownership Company future . Section 382 Internal Revenue Code 1986 amended imposes annual limitation utilization NOL carryforwards tax carryforwards certain builtin loss defined Section upon ownership change . In general term ownership change may result transaction increase aggregate ownership five percent stockholder Kodaks stock 50 percentage point threeyear testing period . The Company relatively high concentration five percent stockholder . There reported transaction within testing period combined future transaction could aggregate ownership change testing period excess 50 percentage point . A Section 382 ownership change would significantly impair Kodaks ability utilize NOLs tax credit U.S. As December 31 2018 Kodak available U.S. NOL carryforwards income tax purpose approximately 804 million unused foreign tax credit 357 million .

Kodak completed analysis based legislative update relating 2017 Tax Act available end 2018 resulting adjustment fully offset Kodaks U.S. valuation allowance resulting net tax provision benefit . Kodak deferred tax liability 22 million 20 million potential tax undistributed earnings including foreign withholding tax December 31 2018 2017 respectively . In general amount tax expense benefit continuing operation determined without regard tax effect category income loss Other comprehensive loss income . However exception rule applies loss continuing operation income item outside continuing operation must considered . This exception requires income discontinued operation extraordinary item item charged credited directly comprehensive income considered determining amount tax benefit result loss continuing operation . This exception affect allocation tax provision amongst category income . Kodak operates within multiple taxing jurisdiction worldwide subject audit jurisdiction . These audit involve complex issue may require extended period time resolution . Managements ongoing assessment outcome issue related tax position require judgment although management belief adequate provision made issue possibility ultimate resolution issue could adverse effect earnings Kodak . Conversely issue resolved favorably future related provision would reduced thus positive impact earnings . Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Kodaks defined benefit pension postretirement benefit cost obligation estimated using several key assumption . These assumption reviewed least annually Kodak include discount rate longterm expected rate return plan asset EROA salary growth healthcare cost trend rate mortality trend economic demographic factor . Actual result differ Kodaks assumption recorded unrecognized gain loss amortized earnings estimated future service period active participant plan plan almost entirely inactive average remaining lifetime expectancy inactive participant extent total net unrecognized gain loss exceed 10 greater plan projected benefit obligation calculated value plan asset . Significant difference actual experience significant change future assumption would affect Kodaks pension postretirement benefit cost obligation . Asset liability modeling study utilized Kodak adjust asset exposure review liability hedging program use forwardlooking correlation risk return estimate . Those forwardlooking estimate correlation risk return generated modeling study also used estimate EROA . The EROA estimated utilizing forwardlooking building block model factoring expected risk asset category return correlation five sevenyear horizon weighting exposure current asset allocation . Historical input utilized forecasting model frame current market environment adjustment made based forwardlooking view . Kodak aggregate investment major asset category based underlying benchmark strategy . Kodaks asset category include broadly diversified exposure U.S. nonU.S . equity U.S. nonU.S . government corporate bond inflationlinked bond commodity absolute return strategy . Each allocation major asset category determined within overall asset allocation accomplish unique objective including enhancing portfolio return providing portfolio diversification hedging plan liability . The EROA set applied calculated value plan asset determination expected return component Kodaks pension expense . Kodak us calculated value plan asset recognizes gain loss fair value asset fouryear period calculate expected return asset . At December 31 2018 calculated value fair value asset Kodaks major U.S. nonU.S . defined benefit pension plan approximately 4.1 billion . Asset gain loss yet reflected calculated value plan asset included amortization unrecognized gain loss . Kodak review EROA assumption annually . To facilitate review every three year market condition change materially Kodaks larger plan undertake asset allocation asset liability modeling study . The weighted average EROA used determine 2018 net pension expense major U.S. nonU.S . defined benefit pension plan 6.40 3.98 respectively . Generally Kodak base discount rate assumption significant plan high quality corporate bond yield respective country measurement date . Specifically U.S. Canadian Eurozone UK plan Kodak determines discount rate using cash flow model incorporate expected timing benefit payment AArated corporate bond yield curve . For Kodaks U.S. plan Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve used . For Kodaks nonU.S . plan discount rate determined comparison published local high quality bond yield index considering estimated plan duration removing outlying bond warranted . 32 Kodak us spot yield curve approach estimate service interest cost applying specific spot rate along yield curve used determine benefit obligation relevant projected cash outflow .
