Improper disclosure information could harm reputation subject liability law protect personal data resulting increased cost loss revenue . If Kodak protect intellectual property right business depends third party assert violates intellectual property right revenue earnings expense liquidity may adversely impacted . A key differentiator Kodak many business technological advantage competitor product solution . Its technological advantage supported Kodaks intellectual property right . Patent copyright trademark trade secret law United States similar law country nondisclosure confidentiality type agreement Kodaks employee customer supplier party may effective establishing maintaining protecting enforcing Kodaks intellectual property right . Any Kodaks direct indirect intellectual property right could challenged invalidated circumvented infringed diluted disclosed misappropriated intellectual property right may sufficient permit take advantage current market trend otherwise provide competitive advantage could result costly product redesign effort discontinuance certain product offering competitive harm . Further law certain country protect proprietary right degree law United States . Therefore certain jurisdiction Kodak may unable protect proprietary technology adequately unauthorized third party copying infringement use could adversely affect competitive position . Also Kodaks business product rely key technology developed licensed third party rapid pace technological change information technology industry may able obtain continue obtain license technology relevant third party reasonable term . Kodak also license third party use trademark . In effort preserve trademark right Kodak enters license agreement third party govern use trademark require licensee abide quality control standard respect good service provide trademark . Although Kodak make effort police use trademark licensee assurance effort sufficient ensure licensee abide term license . In event Kodaks licensee fail trademark right could diluted reputation harmed licensee activity .

Kodak test goodwill indefinite lived intangible asset impairment annually whenever event occur circumstance change would likely reduce fair value reporting unit carrying amount . Kodak evaluates longlived asset impairment whenever event change circumstance indicate carrying value may recoverable . Impairments could occur future Kodaks expected future cash flow decline market interest rate environment deteriorate carrying value change materially compared change respective fair value . 16 Kodaks business experience seasonality sale . Therefore lower demand Kodaks product increase cost period expected peak seasonality may pronounced negative effect result operation . Equipment consumables sale generally exhibit higher level fourth quarter due seasonal nature placement resulting customer industry budgeting practice . As result sequential quartertoquarter comparison good indication Kodaks performance perform future . In addition adverse development expected peak period seasonality lowerthananticipated demand product internal system failure increase material cost failure performance problem one key logistics component supply manufacturing partner could material adverse impact financial condition operating result . Tight credit market limit capital investment weak economy decrease print demand could negatively impact equipment consumable sale . These external development often unpredictable may adverse impact business result operation . If Kodak fails manage distribution product service properly revenue gross margin earnings could adversely impacted . Kodak us variety distribution method sell deliver product service including direct sale thirdparty resellers distributor . Successfully managing interaction direct indirect channel across customer segment product service complex . Since distribution method distinct risk financial implication Kodaks failure achieve advantageous delivery model product service could adversely affect revenue earnings .
