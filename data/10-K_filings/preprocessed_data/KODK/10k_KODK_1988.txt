Kodaks success depends part ability develop introduce new product service timely manner keep pace technological development accepted market . The Company continues introduce new consumer commercial digital product offering . However assurance Company successful anticipating developing new product product enhancement new solution service adequately address changing technology customer requirement . In addition Company unable anticipate develop improvement current technology adapt product changing customer preference requirement continue produce high quality product timely costeffective manner order compete product offered competitor could adversely affect revenue Company . PAGE 11 If continue license enforce intellectual property right business depends third party assert violate intellectual property right revenue earnings expense may adversely impacted . Kodak relies upon patent copyright trademark trade secret law United States similar law country agreement employee customer supplier party establish maintain enforce intellectual property right . Any Companys direct indirect intellectual property right could however challenged invalidated circumvented intellectual property right may sufficient permit Company take advantage current market trend otherwise provide competitive advantage could result costly product redesign effort discontinuance certain product offering competitive harm . Further law certain country protect proprietary right extent law United States . Therefore certain jurisdiction Kodak may unable protect proprietary technology adequately unauthorized third party copying use could adversely affect competitive position . Also rapid pace technological change information technology industry much business many product rely key technology developed licensed third party may able obtain continue obtain license technology third party reasonable term . Kodak made substantial investment new proprietary technology filed patent application obtained patent protect intellectual property right technology well interest Companys licensee . The execution enforcement licensing agreement protects Companys intellectual property right provides revenue stream form royalty enables Kodak innovate provide marketplace new product service . There assurance measure alone adequate protect Companys intellectual property . The Companys ability execute intellectual property licensing strategy could also affect Companys revenue earnings . Kodaks failure develop properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect Companys market position business opportunity .

Portions IT infrastructure may experience interruption delay cessation service product error connection system integration migration work take place time time particular installation SAP within Graphic Communications Group . We may successful implementing new system transitioning data could cause business disruption expensive time consuming disruptive resourceintensive . Such disruption could adversely affect ability fulfill order interrupt process . Delayed sale higher cost lost customer resulting disruption could adversely affect financial result reputation . Our inability effectively complete integrate manage acquisition divestiture significant transaction could adversely impact business performance including financial result . As part business strategy frequently engage discussion third party regarding possible investment acquisition strategic alliance joint venture divestiture outsourcing transaction transaction enter agreement relating transaction order business objective . In order pursue strategy successfully must identify suitable candidate successfully complete transaction may large complex manage postclosing issue integration acquired company employee . Integration risk transaction pronounced larger complicated transaction multiple transaction pursued simultaneously . If fail identify complete successfully transaction strategic objective may required expend resource develop product technology internally may competitive disadvantage may adversely affected negative market perception may material adverse effect revenue gross margin profitability . In 2005 Kodak completed two large business acquisition Graphic Communications Group segment order strengthen diversify portfolio business establishing leader graphic communication market . The Company substantially completed extensive restructuring traditional manufacturing corporate infrastructure need continue rationalize item cost remain competitive . In event Kodak fails effectively manage continuing decline traditional business simultaneously integrating acquisition could fail obtain expected synergy favorable impact acquisition . Such failure could cause Kodak lose market opportunity experience resulting adverse impact revenue earnings . Economic trend major market could adversely affect financial performance . Economic downturn decline consumption Kodaks major market may affect level commercial consumer sale profitability . Purchases Kodaks consumer product significant extent discretionary . Accordingly weakening economic condition outlook could result decline level consumption could adversely affect Kodaks result operation . If timely implement planned working capital improvement could adversely affect cash flow . Unanticipated delay Companys plan continue working capital improvement could adversely impact Kodaks cash flow . Planned inventory reduction could compromised slower sale due deteriorating economic environment competitive environment digital product continuing decline demand traditional product could also place pressure Kodaks sale market share . Conversely account receivable goal could missed due stronger sale decline customer ability pay result economic downturn . In addition Company make expected progress align account payable metric peer group cash flow could negatively impacted . In event Kodak unable successfully manage issue timely manner could adversely impact planned working capital improvement . Delays plan improve manufacturing productivity control cost operation could negatively impact gross margin . Kodaks failure successfully manage operational performance factor could delay curtail planned improvement manufacturing productivity . Delays Kodaks plan improve manufacturing productivity control cost operation could negatively impact gross margin Company . Furthermore Kodak unable successfully negotiate competitive raw material cost supplier incurs adverse pricing certain commoditybased raw material gross margin could adversely impacted . PAGE 13 We depend third party supplier therefore revenue gross margin could suffer fail manage supplier relationship properly . Kodaks operation depend ability anticipate need component product service Kodaks supplier ability deliver sufficient quantity quality component product service reasonable price time Kodak meet customer demand . Given wide variety product service system Kodak offer large number supplier contract manufacturer Company depends upon dispersed across globe long lead time required manufacture assemble deliver certain component product problem could arise planning production managing inventory level could seriously harm Kodak . Other supplier problem Kodak could face include component shortage excess supply risk related term contract supplier risk related dependency single source supplier . We outsourced significant portion overall worldwide manufacturing backoffice operation face risk associated relying third party manufacturer external supplier . We outsourced significant portion overall worldwide manufacturing customer support administrative operation human resource credit collection general ledger accounting function third party various service provider . To extent rely third party manufacturing relationship face risk manufacturer may able develop manufacturing method appropriate product may able maintain adequate control environment may able quickly respond change customer demand product may able obtain supply material necessary manufacturing process may experience labor shortage andor disruption manufacturing cost could higher planned reliability product could decline . If risk realized assuming alternative thirdparty manufacturing relationship could established could experience interruption supply increase cost might result unable meet customer demand product damage relationship customer reduced market share could adversely affect result operation financial condition . If ongoing effort improve supply chain efficiency achieved could adversely affect revenue earnings . Kodaks improvement supply chain efficiency achieved could adversely affect business preventing shipment certain product made desired quantity timely costeffective manner .

The market business highly competitive encounter aggressive price competition product service numerous company globally . Over past several year price competition market digital product including consumer inkjet printer film service particularly intense competitor aggressively cut price lowered profit margin product . In Graphic Communications Group segment aggressive pricing tactic competitor intensified contract negotiation process . Our result operation financial condition may adversely affected industrywide pricing pressure . If Company unable obtain pricing program sufficiently competitive current future competitor Kodak could also lose market share adversely affecting revenue gross margin . If fail manage distribution product service properly revenue gross margin earnings could adversely impacted . The Company us variety different distribution method sell product service including thirdparty resellers distributor direct indirect sale enterprise account customer . Successfully managing interaction direct indirect channel various potential customer segment product service complex process . Moreover since distribution method distinct risk cost failure implement advantageous balance delivery model product service could adversely affect revenue gross margin earnings . Due change Companys gotomarket model Company reliant fewer distributor . This concentrated Companys credit risk appropriately managed could result adverse impact Companys financial performance . PAGE 14 We may provide financing financial guarantee customer may significant amount . The competitive environment operate may require u provide financing customer order win contract . Customer financing arrangement may include portion purchase price product service . We may also assist customer obtaining financing bank source may provide financial guarantee behalf customer . Our success may dependent part upon ability provide customer financing competitive term customer creditworthiness . If unable provide competitive financing arrangement customer extend credit customer creditworthy could adversely impact revenue profitability financial position . Because sell product service worldwide subject change currency exchange rate interest rate may adversely impact result operation financial position . Kodak result global operating financing activity exposed change currency exchange rate interest rate may adversely affect result operation financial position . Exchange rate interest rate certain market Company business tend volatile United States Western Europe . There guarantee economic situation developing market elsewhere worsen could result future effect revenue earnings event occur . If protect reputation due product quality liability issue business could harmed . Kodak product becoming increasingly sophisticated complicated design build rapid advancement technology occur . Although Kodak established internal procedure minimize risk may arise product quality liability issue assurance Kodak able eliminate mitigate occurrence issue associated damage . Kodak may incur expense connection example product recall service lawsuit Kodaks brand image reputation producer highquality product could suffer . Business disruption could seriously harm future revenue financial condition increase cost expense .
