Any significant delay complication development manufacture launch production ramp Model X future vehicle including complication associated expanding production capacity supply chain regulatory approval could materially damage brand business prospect financial condition operating result . Our longterm success dependent upon ability design build achieve market acceptance new vehicle model specifically Model S new vehicle model Model X Model 3 . Our longterm success dependent market acceptance Model S sedan future electric vehicle introduce . In United States guarantee Model S continue successfully accepted general public especially longterm . As expand Europe Asia guarantee customer market embrace vehicle demand vehicle could lower expectation . Moreover assurance able design future electric vehicle meet expectation customer future model including Model X crossover become commercially viable . To date publicly revealed early prototype Model X . Work continues finalization Model X Beta Model X vehicle undergoing extensive testing . To extent able build Model X accordance expectation created early prototype announced specification schedule customer may cancel reservation future sale could harmed investor may lose confidence u . In addition also announced intent develop Model 3 expect produce Tesla Factory introduction Model X . We intend offer vehicle lower price point expect produce higher volume Model S. Importantly anticipate producing Model 3 mass market thus need highvolume supply lithiumion cell reasonable price . While intend production vehicle variant meet distinct segment automotive market vehicle may end competing may delay sale associated revenue future period . Also fail accurately anticipate demand vehicle could result inefficient expenditure production delay . Furthermore historically automobile customer come expect new improved vehicle model introduced frequently . In order meet expectation may required introduce regular basis new vehicle model well enhanced version existing vehicle model . As automotive technology change including specific electric vehicle anticipate customer expect u upgrade adapt vehicle introduce new model order continue provide vehicle latest technology . To date limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting selling electric vehicle well limited experience allocating available resource among design production multiple vehicle . 16 We may unable increase production delivery Model S line plan could harm business prospect . Since began manufacturing delivering Model S 2012 significantly increased production delivery plan call even greater increase production delivery going forward . As part effort recently completed new final assembly line added automation body shop Fremont factory installing highly automated casting machining operation various aluminum component finishing construction new high volume paint shop . Our ability rampup high volume Model S production including AllWheel Drive Dual Motor Model S recently began producing first time depend upon number factor including ability use new manufacturing process planned maintaining desired quality level supplier ability deliver quality part u timely manner efficiently making design change ensure consistently high quality . To produce vehicle meet quality standard requires u carefully analyze step production plan improve efficiency manufacturing process continue train employee . Our supplier also must produce new product sufficient quantity quality meet demand . Certain supplier experienced delay meeting demand sought renegotiate term supply arrangement continue focus supplier capability constraint . Any disruption increasing production level Model S line plan could materially damage brand business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition Model S introduced number new manufacturing technology technique aluminum spot welding system widely adopted automotive industry Model S number new unique design feature 17 inch display screen retractable exterior door handle allnew dual motor autopilot hardware pose unique manufacturing challenge . Model S production delivery continue require significant resource may experience unexpected delay difficulty could harm ability maintain full manufacturing capacity Model S cause u miss planned production target could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Additionally sustaining high volume production manner avoids significant cost overrun including result factor beyond control problem supplier vendor may difficult . Concurrent significant increase planned production level also need continue significantly increase delivery Model S vehicle . We limited experience delivering high volume Model S vehicle particular location outside United States . We may face difficulty meeting delivery growth plan Asia right hand drive market entered may impact ability achieve worldwide delivery goal . If unable ramp meet delivery goal globally match production rate Model S could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . Our ability grow volume production delivery Model S subject certain risk uncertainty including supplier able willing deliver component timely basis necessary quantity quality acceptable price produce Model S volume reach financial target able complete necessary adjustment vehicle design manufacturing process Model S timely manner meet production plan allows high quality vehicle able fully ramp production AllWheel Drive Dual Motor Model S keep demand able ramp sale Model S throughout Asia pursuant current timeline able adequately respond timely manner problem may arise vehicle able schedule complete delivery planned higher volume production level equipment tooling purchased select including part higher capacity production line recently became operational able accurately manufacture vehicle within specified design tolerance suffer unexpected breakdown damage could negatively affect rate needed produce vehicle volume able comply environmental workplace safety custom similar regulation required operate manufacturing facility able maintain improve quality control transition higher level inhouse manufacturing process information technology system currently expanding improving upon effective manage higher volume production . Finally detailed longterm testing quality reliability durability Model S ongoing negative result testing could cause production delivery delay cost increase lower quality Model S vehicle . 17 Problems delay bringing Gigafactory online operating line expectation could negatively affect u . To lower cost cell production produce cell volume allow u grow quickly intend integrate production lithiumion cell finished battery pack vehicle new Gigafactory . Our Gigafactory plan however early stage . While recently entered various formal agreement Panasonic Gigafactory little experience building factory size scope planned Gigafactory experience directly production lithiumion cell . In addition date finalized agreement additional Gigafactory partner colocated Gigafactory . Also cost building operating Gigafactory could exceed current expectation Gigafactory may take longer bring online anticipate . If unable build Gigafactory timely manner produce high volume quality lithiumion cell reasonable price ability supply battery pack vehicle including Model 3 according schedule andor price allows u sell profitably quantity estimate could constrained . Any problem delay Gigafactory could negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . If vehicle vehicle contain powertrains fail perform expected suffer product recall ability develop market sell electric vehicle could harmed . Our vehicle vehicle contain powertrains Toyota RAV4 EV MercedesBenz BClass EV may contain defect design manufacture may cause perform expected may require repair . For example vehicle highly dependent software operate . Software product inherently complex often contain defect error first introduced change software may unexpected effect . Model S issue experienced customer include related software 17 inch display screen panoramic roof 12 volt battery . Although attempt remedy Model S issue experienced customer rapid manner effort may timely satisfaction customer . While performed extensive internal testing currently limited frame reference evaluate longterm performance battery pack powertrains vehicle . Specifically limited amount data evaluate Model S upon business prospect depend due fact recently began production June 2012 . There assurance able detect fix defect vehicle prior sale consumer . We experienced product recall including May 2009 October 2010 June 2013 unrelated electric powertrain . In May 2009 initiated product recall determined condition caused insufficient torqueing rear inner hub flange bolt existed Tesla Roadsters result missed process manufacture Tesla Roadster glider partially assembled Tesla Roadster contain electric powertrain . In October 2010 initiated product recall Tesla Roadsters 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable single vehicle chafed edge carbon fiber panel vehicle causing short smoke possible fire behind right front headlamp vehicle . In June 2013 initiated recall slightly thousand Model S vehicle inspect repair rear seat striker may compromised assembly process . Rear seat striker used retain rear seat back upright position . Failure component may resulted collapse rear seat back crash . Although cost recall material limited small number total Model Ss produced may experience additional recall future could adversely affect brand target market well business prospect result operation . In January 2014 implemented firmware update address issue certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 1450 adapter part charging unit part vehicle potentially overheating charging . We announced would provide upgraded NEMA 1450 adapter customer additional safeguard . If measure adequately address underlying concern business prospect result operation could harmed . Our electric vehicle may perform consistent customer expectation consistent vehicle currently available . For example electric vehicle may durability longevity current vehicle may easy repair vehicle currently market . Additionally Model S recently achieved overall five star safety rating NHTSA guarantee future model year variant Tesla vehicle also attain safety rating rating guarantee safe product design individual vehicle free defect failure . Any product defect failure performance electric vehicle perform expected could harm reputation result adverse publicity lost revenue delivery delay product recall product liability claim harm brand reputation significant warranty expense could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . 18 We dependent supplier majority single source supplier inability supplier continue deliver refusal deliver necessary component vehicle timely manner price quality level volume acceptable u would material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Model S contains numerous purchased part source globally 300 direct supplier majority currently single source supplier component . We expect Model X sourced approximately similar manner . While obtain component multiple source whenever possible similar automobile manufacturer majority component used vehicle purchased u single source . To date qualified alternative source single sourced component used vehicle maintain longterm agreement number supplier . While believe may able establish alternate supply relationship obtain engineer replacement component single source component may unable short term price cost favorable u . In particular believe able secure alternate source supply single sourced component relatively short time frame qualifying alternate supplier developing replacement certain highly customized component vehicle may time consuming costly may force u make additional modification vehicle design . This limited supply chain expose u multiple potential source delivery failure component shortage vehicle well powertrain component sale activity . For example earthquake similar one occurred Japan March 2011 labor issue work stoppage strike port west coast could negatively impact supply chain . We past experienced source disruption supply chain including relating slowerthananticipated ramp Model S production goal 2012 . We may experience additional delay future respect Model S Model X future vehicle may produce . In addition written agreement place majority supplier may create uncertainty regarding supplier obligation u including limited regarding warranty product liability . Changes business condition war governmental change factor beyond control presently anticipate could also affect supplier ability deliver component u timely basis . Furthermore experience significantly increased demand need replace certain existing supplier assurance additional supply component part available required term favorable u supplier would allocate sufficient supply u order meet requirement fill order timely manner . In past replaced certain supplier failure provide component met quality control standard . The loss single limited source supplier disruption supply component supplier could lead delay vehicle delivery customer could hurt relationship customer also materially adversely affect financial condition operating result . Changes supply chain resulted past may result future increased cost delay . We also experienced cost increase certain supplier order meet quality target development timeline well due design change made may experience similar cost increase future . Additionally negotiating existing supplier cost reduction seeking new le expensive supplier certain part attempting redesign certain part make cheaper produce . If unsuccessful effort control reduce supplier cost operating result suffer . Additionally cost reduction effort may interrupt harm normal production process thereby harming vehicle quality reducing Model S production output . Furthermore failure supplier provide component timely manner level quality necessary manufacture performance electric vehicle could prevent u fulfilling customer order timely fashion could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . Finally October 2013 entered amendment existing supply agreement Panasonic Corporation order address anticipated short mediumterm lithiumion battery cell need . While expect supply agreement amended provide u sufficient cell next year may able meet longterm need including Model 3 program may introduce without securing additional supplier source cell . We recently signed agreement Panasonic partner Gigafactory responsible among thing manufacturing cell use product . If encounter unexpected difficulty current supplier including Panasonic unable fill need supplier could experience production delay could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . 19 Our future growth dependent upon consumer willingness adopt electric vehicle . Our growth highly dependent upon adoption consumer subject elevated risk reduced demand alternative fuel vehicle general electric vehicle particular . If market electric vehicle North America Europe Asia develop expect develops slowly expect business prospect financial condition operating result harmed . The market alternative fuel vehicle relatively new rapidly evolving characterized rapidly changing technology price competition additional competitor evolving government regulation industry standard frequent new vehicle announcement changing consumer demand behavior . Other factor may influence adoption alternative fuel vehicle specifically electric vehicle include perception electric vehicle quality safety particular respect lithiumion battery pack design performance cost especially adverse event accident occur linked quality safety electric vehicle related Chevrolet Volt battery pack fire incident involving Model S perception vehicle safety general particular safety issue may attributed use advanced technology including vehicle electronics regenerative braking system negative perception electric vehicle expensive nonelectric vehicle affordable government subsidy limited range electric vehicle may driven single battery charge effect weather range decline electric vehicle range resulting deterioration time battery ability hold charge varied calculation driving range achievable EVs inherently difficult given numerous factor affecting battery range concern electric grid capacity reliability could derail past present effort promote electric vehicle practical solution vehicle require gasoline concern potential customer battery pack charged properly may become unusable may need replaced availability alternative fuel vehicle including plugin hybrid electric vehicle improvement fuel economy internal combustion engine availability service electric vehicle consumer desire ability purchase luxury automobile one perceived exclusive environmental consciousness consumer volatility cost oil gasoline consumer perception dependency United States oil unstable hostile country government regulation economic incentive promoting fuel efficiency alternate form energy well tax governmental incentive purchase operate electric vehicle access charging facility standardization electric vehicle charging system consumer perception convenience cost charge electric vehicle perception actual cost alternative fuel . In addition report suggested potential extreme temperature affect range performance electric vehicle based internal testing estimate vehicle may experience material reduction range operated extremely cold temperature . To extent customer concern reduction third party report suggest reduction range greater estimate gain widespread acceptance ability market sell vehicle particularly colder climate may adversely impacted . 20 Additionally become subject regulation require u alter design vehicle could negatively impact consumer interest vehicle . For example electric vehicle make le noise internal combustion vehicle . Due concern quiet vehicle vision impaired pedestrian January 2011 Congress passed President signed Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act 2010 . The new law requires NHTSA establish minimum sound electric vehicle hybrid electric vehicle travelling low speed . NHTSA issued notice proposed rulemaking 2013 plan finalize rule soon sometime 2015 potential effective date implementation early 2018 . This begin three year phasein schedule establishing minimum sound electric hybrid electric vehicle . Adding artificial noise may cause current potential customer purchase electric vehicle would materially adversely affect business operating result financial condition prospect . If fail manage future growth effectively rapidly grow company especially internationally may able produce market sell service vehicle successfully . Any failure manage growth effectively could materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . We continue expand operation significantly North America well Europe Asia . Our future operating result depend large extent ability manage expansion growth successfully . Risks face undertaking global expansion include finding training new personnel especially new market Europe Asia controlling expense investment anticipation expanded operation establishing expanding sale service Supercharger facility timely manner adapting product meet local requirement country around world implementing enhancing manufacturing logistics administrative infrastructure system process . We intend continue hire significant number additional personnel including manufacturing personnel design personnel engineer service technician . Because highperformance vehicle based different technology platform traditional internal combustion engine may able hire individual sufficient training electric vehicle need expend significant time expense training employee hire . Competition individual experience designing manufacturing servicing electric vehicle intense may able attract assimilate train retain additional highly qualified personnel future failure could seriously harm business prospect operating result financial condition . If unable adequately reduce manufacturing cost Model S control manufacturing cost Model X otherwise control cost associated operating business financial condition operating result suffer . Our production cost Model S high initially due startup cost Tesla Factory manufacturing inefficiency including low absorption fixed manufacturing cost higher logistics cost due immaturity supply chain higher initial price component part initial period launch ramp Model S. As gradually ramped production Model S manufacturing cost per vehicle decreased . While expect cost reduction realized u supplier next several quarter guarantee able achieve sufficient cost saving reach gross margin profitability goal . We incur significant cost related procuring raw material required manufacture highperformance electric car assembling vehicle compensating personnel . We may also incur substantial cost cost overrun increasing production capability Model S powertrain manufacturing facility recent launch Asia . Furthermore unable produce Model X pursuant plan due cost overrun unexpected cost may able meet gross margin target . Furthermore many factor impact operating cost beyond control . For example cost raw material component lithiumion battery cell aluminum used produce body panel could increase due shortage global demand product increase . Indeed popularity electric vehicle exceeds current expectation without significant expansion battery cell production capacity advancement battery cell technology shortage could occur would result increased material cost u potentially limit ability expand production . Additionally may required incur substantial marketing cost expense promote vehicle including use traditional medium television radio print even though marketing expense date relatively limited date relied upon unconventional marketing effort . If unable keep operating cost aligned level revenue generate operating result business prospect harmed . 21 We may fail meet publicly announced guidance expectation business would cause stock price decline . We occasionally provide guidance regarding expected financial business performance projection regarding number vehicle hope sell produce deliver future period anticipated future revenue gross margin profitability cash flow . Correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition predicting future event inherently uncertain process . Our guidance based part assumption include limited assumption regarding ability achieve anticipated production sale volume projected average sale price Model S Model X North America Europe Asia supplier commodityrelated cost planned cost reduction . Such guidance may always accurate may vary actual result due inability meet assumption impact financial performance could occur result various risk uncertainty business set forth risk factor way applicable accounting rule require u treat new product service offering may offer . We offer assurance guidance ultimately accurate investor treat guidance appropriate caution . If fail meet guidance find necessary revise guidance even failure revision seemingly insignificant investor analyst may lose confidence u market value common stock could materially adversely affected . Our vehicle make use lithiumion battery cell observed catch fire vent smoke flame event raised concern future event may lead additional concern battery used automotive application . The battery pack vehicle battery pack sell Toyota Daimler make use lithiumion cell . On rare occasion lithiumion cell rapidly release energy contain venting smoke flame manner ignite nearby material well lithiumion cell . Extremely rare incident laptop computer cell phone electric vehicle battery pack catching fire focused consumer attention safety cell . These event raised concern battery used automotive application . To address question concern number cell manufacturer pursuing alternative lithiumion battery cell chemistry improve safety . We designed battery pack passively contain single cell release energy without spreading neighboring cell . However delivered limited number vehicle customer limited field experience . We also delivered limited number battery pack Toyota Daimler . Accordingly assurance field testing failure vehicle battery pack produce occur could damage vehicle lead personal injury death may subject u lawsuit . We may recall vehicle participate recall vehicle contains battery pack redesign battery pack would time consuming expensive . Also negative public perception regarding suitability lithiumion cell automotive application future incident involving lithiumion cell vehicle fire even incident involve u could seriously harm business . In addition store significant number lithiumion cell manufacturing facility . Any mishandling battery cell may cause disruption operation facility . While implemented safety procedure related handling cell assurance safety issue fire related cell would disrupt operation . Such damage injury would likely lead adverse publicity potentially safety recall . Moreover failure competitor electric vehicle especially use high volume commodity cell similar Teslas vehicle may cause indirect adverse publicity u electric vehicle . Such adverse publicity would negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . We history loss deliver significant cost reduction achieve sustained longterm profitability longterm commercial success . We net loss GAAP basis quarter since inception except first quarter 2013 . Even able continue increase Model S production sale begin produce sell Model X future vehicle assurance profitable . In order achieve profitability well longterm commercial success must continue achieve planned cost reduction control operational cost producing quality vehicle increase production rate maintain strong demand North America grow demand abroad Europe Asia . Failure one thing could prevent u achieving sustained longterm profitability . 22 Foreign currency movement relative U.S. dollar could harm financial result . Our revenue cost denominated foreign currency completely matched . As increased Model S delivery market outside United States much higher revenue cost denominated currency euro Norwegian krone Chinese yuan . The recent strengthening U.S. dollar therefore reduced strengthening U.S. dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar . In addition portion cost expense anticipate continue denominated foreign currency including Japanese yen . If fully offsetting revenue currency value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . As result operating result could adversely affected . The introduction resale value guarantee leasing program may result lower revenue profit expose u resale risk extent many customer elect return vehicle u residual value lower estimate . In 2013 began offering resale value guarantee customer purchased Model S United States Canada financed vehicle one specified commercial banking partner . In April October 2014 started offering leasing business customer individual customer respectively including Tesla Finance captive finance company . Both resale value guarantee program leasing offered Tesla Finance generate lower revenue period car delivered compared cash purchase expose u risk vehicle repurchased returned u program may resold u price le estimate . Under resale value guarantee program Model S customer option selling vehicle back u period 36 39 month following delivery predetermined resale value . As result resale value guarantee customer option selling vehicle u apply lease accounting purchase defers recognition associated revenue time instead full recognition vehicle delivery . Although resale value guarantee impact cash flow liquidity time vehicle delivery significant uptake program could significant adverse impact near term GAAP revenue operating result . Under leasing program offered Tesla Finance lease vehicle directly customer . Customers option purchasing vehicle stated value leasing contract returning vehicle u . We apply lease accounting purchase . Unlike resale value guarantee program may receive small portion price vehicle customer time purchase instead receive stream lease payment . To extent expand program unable secure appropriate financing cash flow liquidity well near term GAAP revenue operating result could negatively impacted . Furthermore exposed credit risk customer may pay lease payment time according term leasing contract . Under program exposed risk vehicle resale value may lower estimate volume vehicle returned u may higher estimate could impact future cash flow andor profitability . Currently limited secondary market electric vehicle base estimate secondary market may develop future . Our residual value return volume estimate could prove incorrect either could harm financial condition operating result . Increases cost disruption supply shortage raw material particular lithiumion cell could harm business . We may experience increase cost sustained interruption supply shortage raw material . Any increase supply interruption could materially negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We use various raw material business including aluminum steel nickel copper . The price raw material fluctuate depending market condition global demand material could adversely affect business operating result . For instance exposed multiple risk relating lithiumion cell . These risk include inability unwillingness current battery manufacturer build operate battery cell manufacturing plant supply number lithiumion cell required support growth electric plugin hybrid vehicle industry demand cell increase disruption supply cell due quality issue recall battery cell manufacturer increase cost raw material nickel used lithiumion cell aluminum used body Model S fluctuation value Japanese yen U.S. dollar battery cell purchase currently denominated Japanese yen . 23 Our business dependent continued supply battery cell vehicle battery pack well battery pack produce automobile manufacturer . While believe several source battery cell available battery pack fully qualified one supplier cell used battery pack limited flexibility changing cell supplier . Any disruption supply battery cell vendor could disrupt production vehicle battery pack produce automobile manufacturer time different supplier fully qualified . Furthermore fluctuation shortage petroleum economic condition may cause u experience significant increase freight charge raw material cost . Substantial increase price raw material price charged u charged battery cell manufacturer would increase operating cost could reduce margin recoup increased cost increased electric vehicle price . There assurance able recoup increasing cost raw material increasing vehicle price . Any attempt increase vehicle price response increased raw material cost could viewed negatively customer result cancellation vehicle order reservation could materially adversely affect brand image business prospect operating result . Our success could harmed negative publicity regarding company product particularly Model S. Occasionally third party evaluate publish story regarding vehicle . For example 2013 New York Times published negative review Model S Supercharger network route Washington D.C. Boston . The story created negative public perception Model S capability Supercharger network . To extent negative comment u product believed public may cause current potential customer purchase electric vehicle including Model S Model X materially adversely affect business operating result financial condition prospect . Our distribution model different predominant current distribution model automobile manufacturer make evaluating business operating result future prospect difficult . Our distribution model common automobile industry today particularly United States . We plan continue sell performance electric vehicle companyowned Tesla store internet . While believe approach important success technology vehicle model vehicle distribution relatively new unproven especially United States subject u substantial risk requires aggregate significant expenditure provides slower expansion distribution sale system may possible utilizing traditional dealer franchise system . For example utilize longestablished sale channel developed franchise system increase sale volume may harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Moreover compete company wellestablished distribution channel . We opened Tesla store North America Europe Asia Pacific Region many open short period time . We relatively limited experience distributing selling performance vehicle Tesla store especially Asia . Our success depend large part ability effectively develop sale channel marketing strategy . Implementing business model subject numerous significant challenge including obtaining permit approval local state authority may successful addressing challenge . The concept layout interactive store typically located high profile retail center different previously used automotive sale . We know whether store strategy continue successful . We may incur additional cost order improve change retail strategy . Other aspect distribution model also differ used traditional automobile manufacturer . For example anticipate ever carry significant amount vehicle inventory store customer may need wait month time place order time receive vehicle . This type custom manufacturing unusual premium sedan market United States unproven whether average customer willing wait amount time vehicle . If customer embrace ordering retail experience business harmed . 24 We may become subject product liability claim could harm financial condition liquidity able successfully defend insure claim . We may become subject product liability claim could harm business prospect operating result financial condition . The automobile industry experience significant product liability claim face inherent risk exposure claim event vehicle perform expected malfunction resulting personal injury death . Our risk area particularly pronounced given limited number vehicle delivered date limited field experience vehicle . A successful product liability claim u could require u pay substantial monetary award . Moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity vehicle business inhibit prevent commercialization future vehicle candidate would material adverse effect brand business prospect operating result . We selfinsure risk product liability claim meaning product liability claim paid company fund insurance . Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damage may material adverse effect reputation business financial condition . We may able secure additional product liability insurance coverage commercially acceptable term reasonable cost needed particularly face liability product forced make claim policy . We currently expanding improving information technology system . If implementation successful business operation could disrupted operating result could harmed . We currently expanding improving information technology system including implementing new internally developed system assist u management business . In particular volume production Model S necessitates continued development maintenance improvement information technology system U.S. abroad include product data management procurement inventory management production planning execution sale service logistics dealer management financial tax regulatory compliance system . These system support operation enable u produce Model S future vehicle like Model X volume . The implementation maintenance improvement system require significant management time support cost . Moreover inherent risk associated developing improving expanding core system well implementing new system including disruption data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain sale service process . These risk may affect ability manage data inventory procure part supply manufacture sell deliver service vehicle achieve maintain compliance realize available benefit tax law applicable regulation . We sure expanded system required functionality effectively implemented sufficiently maintained . If successfully implement improve maintain system operation may disrupted ability accurately andor timely report financial result could impaired deficiency may arise internal control financial reporting may impact ability certify financial result . If system functionality operate expect may required expend significant resource make correction find alternative source performing function . We may realize benefit Supercharger network could harm business brand operating result . We continue deploy Tesla Superchargers United States Europe Asia . Tesla Superchargers network charging station designed provide fastcharge capability owner Model S vehicle Supercharging option . We intend expand Tesla Supercharger network throughout U.S. Canada Europe Asia may unable due number factor including inability secure delay securing suitable location permit problem negotiating lease landowner obtaining required permit location difficulty interfacing infrastructure various utility company greater expected cost difficulty installing maintaining operating network . We may also unable expand Supercharger network fast intend public expects place charging station place customer believe optimal . Furthermore even Superchargers exist increasing number Model S vehicle well future vehicle Model X may oversaturate available charging bay Superchargers leading increased wait time dissatisfaction customer . In addition announced charging customer access network addition already paid vehicle significant unexpected cost encounter entirely borne u may harm operating result . Although Supercharger network intended address customer concern regarding longdistance travel network may result increased reservation sale Model S future vehicle like Model X . If Supercharger network expanded currently planned quickly planned may realize benefit Supercharger network business operating result could materially affected . 25 If unable design develop market sell new electric vehicle address additional market opportunity business prospect operating result suffer . We may able successfully develop new electric vehicle address new market segment develop significantly broader customer base . In 2012 publicly revealed early prototype Model X crossover first vehicle intend develop leveraging Model S platform currently testing Beta Model X vehicle . We also announced intent develop Model 3 based smaller platform Model S expect produce Tesla Factory introduction Model X . Model 3 currently planned lower cost smaller sedan designed mass market . Therefore intend manufacture Model 3 significantly higher volume Model S assurance successfully scale business accordingly . In addition yet finalized design engineering component sourcing plan Model 3 assurance able bring vehicle market price point volume currently intend . The market vehicle price range expect Model 3 much competitive Model S Model X therefore margin likely lower compared Model S Model X margin . Our effort manufacture sell sufficiently profitable Model 3 may successful therefore business prospect operating result may suffer . Our failure address additional market opportunity would harm business prospect financial condition operating result . The automotive market highly competitive may successful competing industry . We currently face competition new established competitor expect face competition others future . The worldwide automotive market particularly alternative fuel vehicle highly competitive today expect become even future . Other automobile manufacturer entered electric vehicle market end 2010 expect additional competitor enter market . With respect Model S face competition existing future automobile manufacturer extremely competitive premium sedan market including Audi BMW Lexus Mercedes . Many established new automobile manufacturer entered announced plan enter alternative fuel vehicle market . BMW Daimler Nissan Fiat Ford Mitsubishi among others electric vehicle available today . Moreover Porsche Lexus Audi Volkswagen Volvo also developing electric vehicle . In addition several manufacturer including General Motors Toyota Ford Honda selling hybrid vehicle certain manufacturer announced plugin version hybrid vehicle . For example December 2010 General Motors introduced Chevrolet Volt plugin hybrid vehicle operates purely electric power limited number mile time internal combustion engine engages recharge battery pack . Moreover reported many large OEMs Daimler Lexus Audi also developing electric vehicle . Several new startup also entered announced plan enter market performance electric vehicle . Finally electric vehicle already brought market China foreign country expect number manufacturer enter United States market well . Most current potential competitor significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing resource may able devote greater resource design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale support product .

As business grows economic condition trend country region currently sell electric vehicle Europe Asia impact business prospect operating result well . Demand electric vehicle may also affected factor directly impacting automobile price cost purchasing operating automobile sale financing incentive price raw material part component cost fuel governmental regulation including tariff import regulation tax . Volatility demand may lead lower vehicle unit sale increased inventory may result downward price pressure adversely affect business prospect financial condition operating result . These effect may pronounced impact business given relatively smaller scale financial resource compared many incumbent automobile manufacturer . If unable establish maintain confidence longterm business prospect among consumer analyst within industry financial condition operating result business prospect stock price may suffer materially . Our vehicle highly technical product require maintenance support . If cease cut back operation even year buyer vehicle year earlier might much difficulty maintaining vehicle obtaining satisfactory support . As result consumer may le likely purchase vehicle convinced business succeed operation continue many year . Similarly supplier third party le likely invest time resource developing business relationship u convinced business succeed . If required curtail expansion plan future done past may result negative perception regarding longterm business prospect may lead cancellation Model S Model X order reservation . Accordingly order build maintain business must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst party liquidity longterm business prospect . In contrast established automaker believe case task maintaining confidence may particularly complicated factor following limited operating history unfamiliarity uncertainty Model X future Tesla vehicle uncertainty longterm marketplace acceptance alternative fuel vehicle generally electric vehicle specifically perceived prospect need ongoing infusion external capital fund planned operation size expansion plan comparison existing capital base scope history operation prospect actual emergence direct sustained competitive pressure established automaker may likely initial effort perceived commercially successful . Many factor largely outside control negative perception longterm business prospect even exaggerated unfounded would likely harm business make difficult raise additional fund needed . We limited experience servicing vehicle especially certain region outside United States using different service model one typically used industry . If unable address service requirement existing future customer business materially adversely affected . If unable successfully address service requirement existing future customer meet customer expectation regarding service business prospect materially adversely affected . We limited experience servicing vehicle especially Europe Asia . Servicing electric vehicle different servicing vehicle internal combustion engine requires specialized skill including high voltage training servicing technique . If unable satisfactorily service customer various service related issue facing may face future ability generate customer loyalty grow business sell additional vehicle could impaired . 27 We service performance electric vehicle companyowned Tesla service center certain store mobile service technician known Tesla Rangers . However certain service center open short period outside United States date limited experience servicing performance vehicle location . We need open new standalone service center location around world hire train significant number new employee staff service center act Tesla Rangers order successfully maintain fleet delivered performance electric vehicle . We implemented Tesla Rangers program October 2009 limited experience deploying service customer vehicle . There assurance service arrangement limited experience servicing vehicle adequately address service requirement customer satisfaction sufficient resource meet service requirement timely manner volume vehicle able deliver annually increase . We expect able open Tesla service center geographic area existing potential customer may reside . In order address service need customer geographical proximity service center plan either transport vehicle nearest Tesla store service center servicing deploy mobile Tesla Rangers service vehicle customer location . These special arrangement may expensive may able recoup cost providing service customer . In addition number potential customer may choose purchase vehicle lack widespread service network . If adequately address customer service need brand reputation adversely affected turn could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . Traditional automobile manufacturer United States provide maintenance repair service directly . Consumers must rather service vehicle franchised dealership third party maintenance service provider . We arrangement third party service provider unclear even whether third party service provider able acquire expertise service vehicle . At point anticipate providing substantially service vehicle foreseeable future . As vehicle placed location may encounter negative reaction consumer frustrated use local service station extent conventional automobile frustration may result negative publicity reduced sale thereby harming business prospect . In addition motor vehicle industry law many state require service facility available respect vehicle physically sold location state . Whether law would also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet consumer state physical presence uncertain . While believe Tesla Ranger program practice transporting customer vehicle nearest Tesla service center would satisfy regulator circumstance without seeking formal regulatory guidance assurance regulator attempt require provide physical service facility state . Further certain state franchise law prohibit manufacturer licensed dealer acting capacity dealer also restrict manufacturer providing vehicle service . If issue arise connection law certain aspect Teslas service program would need restructured comply state law may harm business . We may succeed maintaining strengthening Tesla brand would materially adversely affect customer acceptance vehicle component business revenue prospect . Our business prospect heavily dependent ability develop maintain strengthen Tesla brand . Any failure develop maintain strengthen brand may materially adversely affect ability sell Model S Model X Model 3 future planned electric vehicle sell electric powertrain component . If continue establish maintain strengthen brand may lose opportunity build critical mass customer . Promoting positioning brand likely depend significantly ability provide high quality electric car maintenance repair service limited experience area . Any problem associated Toyota RAV4 EV MercedesBenz BClass EV use Tesla powertrain Model X may hurt Tesla brand . In addition expect ability develop maintain strengthen Tesla brand also depend heavily success marketing effort . To date limited experience marketing activity relied primarily internet word mouth attendance industry trade show promote brand . To promote brand may required change marketing practice could result substantially increased advertising expense including need use traditional medium television radio print . The automobile industry intensely competitive may successful building maintaining strengthening brand . Many current potential competitor particularly automobile manufacturer headquartered Detroit Japan European Union greater name recognition broader customer relationship substantially greater marketing resource . If develop maintain strong brand business prospect financial condition operating result materially adversely impacted . 28 If vehicle owner customize vehicle change charging infrastructure aftermarket product vehicle may operate properly could harm business . Automobile enthusiast may seek hack vehicle modify performance could compromise vehicle safety system . Also aware customer customized vehicle aftermarket part may compromise driver safety . For example customer installed seat elevate driver airbag safety system could compromised . Other customer changed wheel tire others installed large speaker system may impact electrical system vehicle . We tested endorse change product . In addition customer use improper external cabling unsafe charging outlet expose customer injury high voltage electricity . Such unauthorized modification could reduce safety vehicle injury resulting modification could result adverse publicity would negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result .

If experience delay expanding network Tesla store service center Superchargers could lead decrease sale vehicle could negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We opened Tesla store service center major metropolitan area throughout North America Europe Asia plan open additional store service center worldwide support ongoing worldwide Model S rollout . We also rapidly expanded Supercharger network U.S. Europe China . However may able expand sufficient rate planned expansion require significant cash investment management resource well efficiency execution establishing location hiring training necessary employee effectively sell service vehicle . Furthermore certain state foreign jurisdiction may permit requirement franchise dealer law similar law regulation may preclude restrict ability open store sell vehicle state jurisdiction . Any prohibition restriction may lead decreased sale jurisdiction could harm business prospect operating result . See Risk Factor We may face regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle directly internet could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . Additionally may face potential difficulty finding suitable Supercharger site desired location negotiating lease obtaining required permit location . We face risk associated international operation expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax labor condition establishing new market could harm business . We face various risk associated international operation expansion . We currently international operation subsidiary various country jurisdiction Europe Asia subject legal political regulatory social requirement economic condition jurisdiction . Additionally part growth strategy continue expand sale maintenance repair Supercharger service internationally particularly China . However limited experience date selling servicing vehicle internationally well limited experience installing operating Superchargers internationally international expansion requires u make significant expenditure including establishment local operating entity hiring local employee establishing facility advance generating revenue . We subject number risk associated international business activity may increase cost impact ability sell electric vehicle require significant management attention . These risk include conforming vehicle various international regulatory safety requirement vehicle sold homologation difficulty establishing staffing managing foreign operation difficulty attracting customer new jurisdiction foreign government tax regulation permit requirement including foreign tax may able offset tax imposed upon u United States foreign tax law limiting ability repatriate fund United States fluctuation foreign currency exchange rate interest rate including risk related interest rate swap hedging activity undertake 29 ability enforce contractual intellectual property right especially foreign country respect protect intellectual property right extent United States Japan European country increase risk unauthorized uncompensated use technology United States foreign government trade restriction custom regulation tariff price exchange control foreign labor law regulation restriction preference foreign nation domestically produced vehicle change diplomatic trade relationship political instability natural disaster war event terrorism strength international economy . Additionally expanded new international market faced challenge ensuring charging equipment work successfully charging infrastructure market . For example encountered challenge Norway China . If customer experience problem way charging equipment work local charging infrastructure unable adapt equipment resolve problem viability acceptance vehicle market could materially adversely affected . If fail successfully address risk business prospect operating result financial condition could materially harmed . Developments alternative technology improvement internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect demand electric vehicle . Significant development alternative technology advanced diesel ethanol hydrogen fuel cell compressed natural gas improvement fuel economy internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect business prospect way currently anticipate . Any failure u develop new enhanced technology process react change existing technology could materially delay development introduction new enhanced electric vehicle could result loss competitiveness vehicle decreased revenue loss market share competitor . The unavailability reduction elimination uncertainty regarding government economic incentive U.S. abroad could material adverse effect business financial condition operating result prospect . Any reduction elimination government economic incentive due policy change reduced need incentive customer base electric vehicle expands fiscal tightening reason may result diminished competitiveness alternative fuel vehicle industry generally electric vehicle particular . Such reduction elimination incentive could materially adversely affect growth well business prospect financial condition operating result growth depends part availability amount government incentive . For example currently benefit certain exemption United States California state sale use tax . Similarly government program Europe favor purchase electric vehicle including disincentive discourage use gaspowered vehicle . In Norway example purchase electric vehicle currently subject import tax tax nonrecurring vehicle fee 25 value added tax purchase tax apply purchase gaspowered vehicle . If government program reduced eliminated available benefit thereunder exhausted earlier anticipated sale electric vehicle including Model S could adversely affected . In addition customer certain market may delay taking delivery Tesla vehicle believe certain electric vehicle incentive available later date may negatively affect ability achieve planned delivery target . Our strategic relationship third party Panasonic subject various risk could adversely affect business future prospect . Our strategic relationship third party Panasonic supply u battery cell use Model S Model X partner Gigafactory pose various risk u including potential loss access important technology vehicle part potential loss business adverse publicity . In addition third party may perform expected agreement respect vehicle part quality timeliness may disagreement dispute third party . The occurrence foregoing could adversely affect business prospect financial condition operating result . 30 The operation vehicle different internal combustion engine vehicle customer may experience difficulty operating properly including difficulty transitioning different method braking . We designed vehicle minimize inconvenience inadvertent driver damage powertrain . In certain instance protection may cause vehicle behave way unfamiliar driver internal combustion vehicle . For example employ regenerative braking recharge battery pack mode vehicle operation . Our customer may become accustomed using regenerative braking instead wheel brake slow vehicle . However vehicle maximum charge regenerative braking needed employed vehicle . Accordingly customer may difficulty shifting different method braking . In addition use safety mechanism limit motor torque powertrain system reach elevated temperature . In instance vehicle acceleration speed decrease . Finally driver permit battery pack substantially deplete charge vehicle progressively limit motor torque speed preserve charge remains . The vehicle lose speed ultimately coast stop . Despite several warning imminent loss charge ultimate loss speed may unexpected . There assurance customer operate vehicle properly especially situation . Any accident resulting failure operate vehicle properly could harm brand reputation result adverse publicity product liability claim material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition consumer dislike feature may choose buy additional car u could also harm business prospect . If unable keep advance electric vehicle technology may suffer decline competitive position . We may unable keep change electric vehicle technology result may suffer decline competitive position . Any failure keep advance electric vehicle technology would result decline competitive position would materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . Our research development effort may sufficient adapt change electric vehicle technology . As technology change plan upgrade adapt vehicle introduce new model order continue provide vehicle latest technology particular battery cell technology . However vehicle may compete effectively alternative vehicle able source integrate latest technology vehicle . For example currently manufacture battery cell make u dependent upon supplier battery cell technology battery pack . If unable attract andor retain key employee hire qualified management technical vehicle engineering manufacturing personnel ability compete could harmed stock price may decline . The loss service key employee could disrupt operation delay development introduction vehicle service negatively impact business prospect operating result well cause stock price decline . In particular highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer Product Architect Chairman Board Directors JB Straubel Chief Technical Officer . None key employee bound employment agreement specific term . There assurance able successfully attract retain senior leadership necessary grow business . Our future success depends upon ability attract retain executive officer key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing support personnel failure could adversely impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We past may future experience difficulty retaining member senior management team well technical vehicle engineering manufacturing personnel due various factor competitive labor market talented individual automotive experience . In addition key person life insurance policy covering officer key employee . Currently Northern California increasing competition talented individual specialized knowledge electric vehicle software engineer manufacturing engineer skilled employee competition affect ability retain key employee hire new one . Our continued success depends upon continued ability hire new employee timely manner retain current employee . Additionally compete many mature prosperous company Northern California far greater financial resource thus offer current perspective employee lucrative incentive package . Any difficulty retaining current employee recruiting new one would adverse effect performance . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer Product Architect Chairman Board Directors largest stockholder . Although Mr. Musk spends significant time Tesla highly active management devote full time attention Tesla . Mr. Musk also currently serf Chief Executive Officer Chief Technical Officer Space Exploration Technologies developer manufacturer space launch vehicle Chairman SolarCity solar equipment installation company . 31 We subject various environmental safety law regulation could impose substantial cost upon u negatively impact ability operate manufacturing facility . As automobile manufacturer subject national state provincial andor local environmental health safety law regulation including law relating use handling storage disposal human exposure hazardous material United States abroad . Environmental health safety law regulation complex expect business operation affected new future amendment law may require u change operation potentially resulting material adverse effect business . These law give rise liability administrative oversight cost cleanup cost property damage bodily injury associated fine penalty . Capital operating expense needed comply environmental health safety law regulation significant violation law may result substantial fine penalty third party damage suspension production cessation operation . These expense could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Contamination property formerly owned operated u well property operate property hazardous substance sent u may result liability u environmental law regulation including limited Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation Liability Act CERCLA . The government impose liability u CERCLA full amount remediationrelated cost contaminated site without regard fault . Such cost include associated investigation cleanup contaminated soil ground water building well reverse impact human health damage natural resource . We may also face unexpected delay obtaining necessary permit approval required environmental law connection manufacturing facility could require significant time financial resource negatively impact ability operate facility would adversely impact business prospect operating result . As owner Tesla Factory surrounding land may responsible federal state law regulation entire investigation remediation environmental contamination Tesla Factory whether occurred date purchased property . When Tesla purchased property previous owner operator Tesla Factory New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. NUMMI identified environmental condition Tesla Factory could adversely affect soil groundwater agreed remediate condition . Although NUMMI stated fully documented managed environmental issue Tesla Factory determine certainty truth statement total cost remediate preexisting contamination may eventually found . We reached agreement NUMMI ten year period pay first 15.0 million cost governmentallyrequired remediation activity contamination existed prior closing purchase known unknown environmental condition Remediation Activities NUMMI agreed pay next 15.0 million Remediation Activities . Our agreement provides part NUMMI pay first 15.0 million behalf expense incurred first four year agreement subject reimbursement cost fourth anniversary date closing . On either tenyear anniversary closing whenever 30.0 million spent Remediation Activities whichever come first NUMMIs liability u respect Remediation Activities cease responsible environmental condition Fremont site . At point time agreed indemnify defend hold harmless NUMMI liability including attorney fee cost penalty may incur arising connection claim relating environmental condition released NUMMI known unknown claim except NUMMIs obligation representation warranty agreement . There assurance NUMMI perform obligation agreement NUMMIs failure perform would require u undertake obligation potentially significant cost . Such performance may also adversely affect production capacity ability operate Tesla Factory . Any Remediation Activities environmental condition Fremont site could harm operation future use value Fremont site could delay production plan Model S. Our business may adversely affected union activity . Although none employee currently represented labor union common throughout automobile industry generally many employee automobile company belong union result higher employee cost increased risk work stoppage . Our employee may join seek recognition form labor union may required become union signatory . Our automobile production facility Fremont California purchased NUMMI . Prior employee NUMMI union member future work force facility may inclined vote favor forming labor union . We also operate another component manufacturing facility Lathrop California . Furthermore directly indirectly dependent upon company unionized work force part supplier trucking freight company work stoppage strike organized union could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result . If work stoppage occurs could delay manufacture sale performance electric vehicle material adverse effect business prospect operating result financial condition . The mere fact labor force could unionized may harm reputation eye investor thereby negatively affect stock price . Consequently unionization labor force could negatively impact company health . 32 We subject substantial regulation evolving unfavorable change failure u comply regulation could substantially harm business operating result . The production sale motor vehicle general specifically related electric vehicle subject substantial regulation international federal state local law . We incurred expect continue incur significant cost complying regulation . Regulations related electric vehicle industry alternative energy currently evolving face risk associated change regulation . In United States following example regulatory statutory issue facing u imposition carbon tax introduction capandtrade system electric utility could increase cost electricity increasingly stringent Clean Air Act emission regulation affecting power plant used generate electricity could increase cost electricity change regulation governing assembly transportation lithiumion battery pack UN Recommendations Safe Transport Dangerous Goods Model Regulations regulation adopted U.S . Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA could increase cost lithiumion battery pack restrict transport amendment rescission federal law regulation mandating increased fuel economy United States referred Corporate Average Fuel Economy CAFE standard could reduce new business opportunity powertrain sale development activity amendment rescission federal greenhouse gas tailpipe emission regulation administered EPA authority Clean Air Act could reduce new business opportunity powertrain sale development activity amendment rescission Californias zero emission vehicle ZEV regulation administered California Air Resources Board California Health Safety Code could reduce new business opportunity powertrain sale development activity well ability monetize ZEV credit California also eleven additional state adopted California program increased sensitivity regulator need established automobile manufacturer large employment base high fixed cost business model based internal combustion engine could lead pas regulation could reduce compliance cost established manufacturer mitigate effect government effort promote alternative fuel vehicle change vehiclespecific Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards govern motor vehicle made within United States could result costly change current vehicle produced change regulation governing export product could increase delivery cost outside United States force u charge consumer jurisdiction higher price vehicle . In addition automotive industry move towards greater use electronics vehicle system NHTSA regulatory body may regulate electronic system stringently particularly concern distracted driving increase . Such concern could affect use electronic system Model S 17 inch display screen could reduce appeal Model S require adjustment display screen functionality . As currently delivering vehicle Europe Asia subject law regulation applicable import sale service automobile region . For example required meet vehiclespecific safety standard often materially different U.S. requirement thus resulting additional investment vehicle system ensure regulatory compliance . Unlike U.S. selfcertify vehicle compliance standard must obtain advanced approval regulatory agency regarding proper certification homologation vehicle enter market . This process necessitates foreign regulatory official review certify vehicle prior market entry . In addition must comply regulation applicable vehicle enter market including foreign reporting requirement recall management system . To extent U.S. international law change vehicle may comply new applicable international federal state local law would adverse effect business . Compliance changing regulation could burdensome time consuming expensive . To extent compliance new regulation cost prohibitive business prospect financial condition operating result adversely affected . 33 We retain certain personal information customer may subject various privacy consumer protection law . Our collection use retention security transfer personal information customer subject federal state international law . These law continue enacted may inconsistent jurisdiction jurisdiction . Complying changing international law may cause u incur substantial cost expose u legal liability require u change business practice .

Although take step protect security customer personal information may required expend significant resource comply data breach requirement third party improperly obtain use personal information customer otherwise experience data loss respect customer personal information . A major breach network security system could serious negative consequence business future prospect including possible fine penalty damage reduced customer demand vehicle harm reputation brand . We may compelled undertake product recall take action could adversely affect brand image financial performance . Any product recall future may result adverse publicity damage brand adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . We previously experienced product recall May 2009 October 2010 June 2013 none related electric powertrain . In April 2009 determined condition caused insufficient torqueing rear inner hub flange bolt existed Tesla Roadsters result missed process manufacture Tesla Roadster glider . In October 2010 initiated product recall 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable single vehicle chafed edge carbon fiber panel vehicle causing short smoke possible fire behind right front headlamp vehicle . In June 2013 initiated recall slightly one thousand Model S vehicle inspect repair rear seat striker may compromised assembly process . Rear seat striker used retain rear seat back upright position . Failure component may resulted collapse rear seat back crash . Finally January 2014 implemented firmware update address issue certain Universal Mobile Connector NEMA 1450 adapter part charging unit part vehicle potentially overheating charging . In future may various time voluntarily involuntarily initiate recall vehicle including Model S electric powertrain component prove defective noncompliant applicable federal motor vehicle safety standard . Such recall voluntary involuntary involve significant expense diversion management attention resource could adversely affect brand image target market well business prospect financial condition result operation . Our current future warranty reserve may insufficient cover future warranty claim could adversely affect financial performance . If warranty reserve inadequate cover future warranty claim vehicle business prospect financial condition operating result could materially adversely affected . Warranty reserve include management best estimate projected cost repair replace item warranty . These estimate based actual claim incurred todate estimate nature frequency cost future claim . These estimate inherently uncertain change historical projected experience may cause material change warranty reserve future . Subject separate limited warranty supplemental restraint system battery provide four year 50000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty purchaser Model S. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty Model S also cover drive unit eight year battery period eight year 125000 mile unlimited mile depending size vehicle battery although battery charging capacity covered New Vehicle Limited Warranty Extended Service plan . In addition customer opportunity purchase Extended Service plan period end New Vehicle Limited Warranty Model S cover additional service additional four year 50000 mile provided purchased within specified period time . The New Vehicle Limited Warranty Extended Service plan Tesla Roadster Model S subject certain limitation exclusion separate warranty including certain wear item tire brake pad paint general appearance battery performance intended cover part labor repair defect material workmanship vehicle including body chassis suspension interior electronic system powertrain brake system . We previously provided Tesla Roadster customer battery replacement option replace battery vehicle time expiration New Vehicle Limited Warranty tenth anniversary purchase date vehicle . Additionally 2013 part ongoing effort improve customer ownership experience expanded battery pack warranty also eliminated annual service requirement needed keep New Vehicle Limited Warranty effect . Should change warranty coverage lead increase warranty claim may need record additional warranty reserve would negatively affect profitability . 34 Our insurance strategy may adequate protect u business risk . We may subject ordinary course business loss resulting product liability accident act God claim u may insurance coverage . While currently maintain general liability automobile property worker compensation director officer insurance policy general matter maintain much insurance coverage many company case maintain . Additionally policy may include significant deductible certain insurance coverage sufficient cover future claim u . A loss uninsured exceeds policy limit may require u pay substantial amount could adversely affect financial condition operating result . Our financial result may vary significantly periodtoperiod due fluctuation operating cost seasonality business . We expect periodtoperiod operating result vary based operating cost anticipate increase significantly future period among thing design develop manufacture Model X future product increase production capacity manufacturing facility produce vehicle higher volume develop Gigafactory open new Tesla service center maintenance repair capability open new Supercharger location increase sale marketing activity increase general administrative function support growing operation . As result factor believe quartertoquarter comparison operating result especially shortterm necessarily meaningful comparison relied upon indicator future performance . Moreover operating result may meet expectation equity research analyst investor . If occurs trading price common stock could fall substantially either suddenly time . Additionally sale new car automobile industry typically decline winter season generally higher spring summer month . We anticipate sale Model S future model may similar seasonality limited operating history make difficult u judge exact nature extent seasonality business . Our operating result could also suffer achieve revenue consistent expectation seasonal demand many expense based anticipated level annual revenue . Unauthorized control manipulation vehicle system may cause operate improperly compromise safety data security could result loss confidence u vehicle harm business . There report vehicle automobile manufacturer hacked grant access operation vehicle unauthorized person wouldbe thief . Our vehicle particular Model S technologically advanced machine requiring interoperation numerous complex evolving hardware software system . Subject customer ability opt pursuant privacy policy Model S designed builtin data connectivity accept install periodic remote update u improve update functionality system . Although designed implemented tested security measure prevent unauthorized access vehicle system information technology network communication vehicle may vulnerable interception manipulation damage disruption shutdown due attack hacker breach due error personnel access network system . Any attack breach could result unexpected control change vehicle functionality user interface performance characteristic . Hackers may also use similar mean gain access data stored generated vehicle current geographical position previous stored destination address history web browser favorite . Any unauthorized control vehicle access loss information could result legal claim proceeding negative publicity would negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . The range power electric vehicle single charge decline time may negatively influence potential customer decision whether purchase vehicle . The range power electric vehicle single charge decline principally function usage time charging pattern well factor . How customer us Tesla vehicle frequency recharging battery pack low state charge mean charging result additional deterioration battery pack ability hold charge long term . For example currently expect battery pack Tesla Roadster retain approximately 70 ability hold initial charge approximately 100000 mile seven year result decrease vehicle initial range power . Preliminary internal testing customer result Model S date suggest deterioration Model S battery pack le Roadster however battery pack deterioration related decrease range power time well perceived deterioration fluctuation range may negatively influence potential customer decision whether purchase vehicle may harm ability market sell vehicle . 35 We may need want raise additional fund fund may available u need . If raise additional fund need want operation prospect could negatively affected . The design manufacture sale servicing automobile capital intensive business . We expect principal source liquidity provide u adequate liquidity based current plan . However consistently generating positive free cash flow cost developing manufacturing Model X exceed expectation incur significant unplanned expense embark accelerate new significant strategic investment Gigafactory may need raise additional fund issuance equity equityrelated debt security obtaining credit government financial institution . This capital necessary fund ongoing operation continue research development project including planned Model X crossover Model 3 vehicle establish sale service center build deploy Superchargers make investment tooling manufacturing capital required introduce Model X . We certain additional fund available u favorable term required . If raise additional fund need financial condition result operation business prospect could materially adversely affected . If fail effectively manage residual financing credit risk recently launched Model S leasing program business may suffer . We recently introduced leasing program United States Canada captive finance company Tesla Finance . The profitability leasing program depends ability accurately project residual value secure adequate financing andor business partner fund grow program manage customer credit risk . If actual residual value Model S vehicle estimate may suffer lower profitability potentially loss . If unable adequately fund leasing program either internal fund external financing source may unable grow sale . Additionally properly screen customer ability pay lease time may exposed excessive credit risk associated loss . Furthermore leasing business grows substantially business may suffer effectively manage greater level residual credit risk resulting growth . Finally successfully monitor comply federal state financial regulation consumer protection law governing lease transaction may become subject enforcement action penalty either may harm business . Any failure execute Daimler BClass EV program could hurt reputation well profitability program . We worked Daimler develop full electric powertrain Daimler MercedesBenz BClass EV vehicle . We substantially completed development service BClass program commenced production electric powertrains battery pack Daimler . The supply agreement product contemplates customary obligation u timely delivery warranty product defect obligation . If fail meet obligation exceed current cost projection producing product profitability program suffer could negative impact operating result . We may face regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle directly internet could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . We sell vehicle Tesla store well internet . We may able sell vehicle sale model state United States many state law may interpreted prohibit internet sale manufacturer resident state impose limitation sale model including law prohibit manufacturer selling vehicle directly consumer without use independent dealership without physical presence state . In certain state able obtain dealer license worked state regulator open gallery location potential customer view vehicle full retail location . It possible state regulator could later determine activity gallery constitute unlicensed sale motor vehicle . In many state application state motor vehicle law specific sale model largely untested state motor vehicle industry law determined fact specific analysis numerous factor including whether physical presence employee applicable state whether advertise conduct activity applicable state sale transaction structured volume sale state whether state question prohibits manufacturer acting dealer . As result fact specific largely untested nature issue fact applying law intended traditional automobile distribution model sale model allows interpretation discretion regulator manner applicable authority applying state law distribution model continues difficult predict . Laws state limited ability obtain dealer license state motor vehicle regulator may continue . 36 In addition decision regulator permitting u sell vehicle may subject challenge whether decision comply applicable state motor vehicle industry law . For example vehicle dealer association New York Ohio Massachusetts filed lawsuit revoke dealer license issued u . These lawsuit dismissed one recent court decision Supreme Court Massachusetts held state franchise law like one Massachusetts restrict manufacturer like Tesla use franchised dealer selling vehicle directly consumer . Such result reinforced continuing belief state law designed prevent distribution model . Similar lawsuit filed Georgia Missouri . Possible additional challenge state successful could restrict prohibit ability sell vehicle resident state . In state also regulatory legislative effort vehicle dealer association propose bill regulation enacted would prevent u obtaining dealer license state given current sale model . Such event recently occurred New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission behest local automobile dealer lobby passed new regulation purported invalidate sale license state Michigan state automobile dealer association managed add language unrelated bill effect impairing right sell vehicle Tesla store Michigan . We brought lawsuit New Jersey invalidate regulation believe unlawful evaluating legislative litigation solution remedy situation Michigan . Other state New York Ohio Pennsylvania passed legislation clarifies ability operate time limit number dealer license obtain store operate . We also registered motor vehicle manufacturer dealer Canada Australia Japan obtained license sell vehicle place Hong Kong China . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict sale business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . We may need defend patent trademark infringement claim may timeconsuming would cause u incur substantial cost . Companies organization individual including competitor may hold obtain patent trademark proprietary right would prevent limit interfere ability make use develop sell market vehicle component could make difficult u operate business . From time time may receive communication holder patent trademark regarding proprietary right . Companies holding patent intellectual property right may bring suit alleging infringement right otherwise assert right urge u take license . In addition determined infringed upon third party intellectual property right may required one following cease selling incorporating using vehicle offering good service incorporate use challenged intellectual property pay substantial damage obtain license holder infringed intellectual property right license may available reasonable term redesign vehicle good service establish maintain alternative branding product service . In event successful claim infringement u failure inability obtain license infringed technology intellectual property right business prospect operating result financial condition could materially adversely affected . In addition litigation claim whether valid could result substantial cost diversion resource management attention . We may also face claim use technology licensed otherwise obtained third party infringes right others . In case may seek indemnification licensorssuppliers contract . However indemnification may unavailable insufficient cover cost loss depending use technology whether choose retain control conduct litigation factor . 37 Our patent application may result issued patent may material adverse effect ability prevent others interfering commercialization product . The status patent involves complex legal factual question breadth effectiveness patented claim uncertain . We certain first creator invention covered pending patent application first file patent application invention certain pending patent application result issued patent issued patent afford sufficient protection someone creating knockoff product defense competitor claim infringing patent . In addition patent application filed foreign country subject law rule procedure differ United States thus certain foreign patent application related issued U.S. patent result issued patent foreign jurisdiction . In addition others may obtain patent need license design around either would increase cost may adversely affect business prospect financial condition operating result . Our trademark application certain country remain subject outstanding opposition proceeding . We currently sell market product service various country Tesla mark . We filed trademark application Tesla mark opposition proceeding trademark application third party various country currently sell plan sell product service . Certain trademark application subject outstanding opposition proceeding brought owner applicant alleging prior application use similar mark . If resolve opposition thereby secure registered right country ability challenge third party user Tesla mark reduced value mark representing exclusive brand name country diluted . In addition risk prior right owner could future take action challenge use Tesla mark country . Such action could severe impact position country may inhibit ability use Tesla mark country . If prevented using Tesla mark country would need expend significant additional financial marketing resource establishing alternative brand identity market . Our facility operation could damaged adversely affected result disaster unpredictable event . Our corporate headquarters Palo Alto Tesla Factory Fremont additional component manufacturing facility Lathrop located Northern California region known seismic activity . If major disaster earthquake fire flood hurricane war terrorist attack computer virus pandemic event occur information system communication network break operates improperly headquarters production facility may seriously damaged may stop delay production shipment product . In addition lease Palo Alto facility permit landlord terminate lease following casualty event needed repair excess certain threshold agree pay uninsured amount . We may incur expense relating damage could material adverse impact business operating result financial condition . If supplier fail use ethical business practice comply applicable law regulation brand image could harmed due negative publicity . Our core value include developing highest quality electric vehicle operating integrity important component brand image make reputation particularly sensitive allegation unethical business practice . We control independent supplier business practice . Accordingly guarantee compliance ethical business practice environmental responsibility fair wage practice appropriate sourcing raw material compliance child labor law among others . A lack demonstrated compliance could lead u seek alternative supplier could increase cost result delayed delivery product product shortage disruption operation . Violation labor law supplier divergence independent supplier labor practice generally accepted ethical United States market business could also attract negative publicity u brand . This could diminish value brand image reduce demand performance electric vehicle result violation attract negative publicity . If manufacturer industry encounter similar problem future could harm brand image business prospect financial condition operating result . 38 Servicing convertible senior note requires significant amount cash may sufficient cash flow business pay substantial debt . We incurred 660.0 million 920.0 million 1.38 billion respectively aggregate principal amount senior indebtedness issued pursuant registered public offering 1.50 convertible senior note due 2018 2018 Notes 2013 0.25 convertible senior note due 2019 2019 Notes 1.25 convertible senior note due 2021 2021 Notes 2014 . Our ability make scheduled payment principal due make quarterly interest payment make payment upon conversion refinance Notes depends future performance subject economic financial competitive factor beyond control . Our business may continue generate cash flow operation future sufficient satisfy obligation Notes future indebtedness may incur make necessary capital expenditure . If unable generate cash flow may required adopt one alternative reducing delaying investment capital expenditure selling asset refinancing obtaining additional equity capital term may onerous highly dilutive . Our ability refinance Notes future indebtedness depend capital market financial condition time . We may able engage activity engage activity desirable term could result default Notes future indebtedness . Pursuant term holder may convert Notes option time prior final threemonth period scheduled term respective Notes certain circumstance . For example holder may generally convert Notes option quarter quarter commencing fourth quarter 2013 case 2018 Notes third quarter 2014 case 2019 Notes 2021 Notes last reported sale price common stock least 20 trading day whether consecutive period 30 consecutive trading day ending last trading day immediately preceding quarter greater equal 130 conversion price series Notes applicable trading day . As result conversion feature 2018 Notes convertible holder option quarter commencing fourth quarter 2013 except first quarter 2014 . Neither conversion feature met respect 2019 Notes 2021 Notes consequently 2019 Notes 2021 convertible holder option Upon conversion Notes obligated make cash payment respect principal amount thereof may also deliver cash applicable share common stock respect Notes . Any conversion Notes prior maturity acceleration repayment Notes future indebtedness applicable notice grace period could material adverse effect business result operation financial condition . In addition holder Notes right require u purchase Notes upon occurrence fundamental change purchase price equal 100 principal amount Notes plus accrued unpaid interest including fundamental change purchase date . However may enough available cash able obtain financing time required make purchase Notes surrendered therefor Notes converted . In addition ability purchase Notes pay cash upon conversion Notes may limited law regulatory authority agreement governing future indebtedness . Our failure purchase Notes time purchase required indenture pay cash payable future conversion Notes required indenture would constitute default indenture . If repayment related indebtedness accelerated applicable notice grace period may sufficient fund repay indebtedness purchase Notes make cash payment upon conversion thereof . We may still incur substantially debt take action would intensify risk discussed .

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion analysis read conjunction consolidated financial statement related note appear elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . Overview 2014 Highlights We design develop manufacture sell highperformance fully electric vehicle advanced electric vehicle powertrain component stationary energy storage application . We currently producing selling second vehicle Model S sedan . Model S four door fivepassenger premium sedan offer exceptional performance functionality attractive styling . The Model S inherited many electric powertrain innovation introduced first vehicle Tesla Roadster . We commenced delivery Model S June 2012 delivered 56768 vehicle December 31 2014 . We recently announced availability AllWheel Drive Dual Motor Model S began delivery starting performanceoptimized version December 2014 . We continuing develop Model X crossover vehicle intend commence customer delivery third quarter 2015 . After Model X goal introduce Model 3 lower priced sedan designed mass market 2017 . Our primary source revenue sale vehicle . During year ended December 31 2014 recognized total revenue 3.20 billion increase 1.19 billion total revenue 2.01 billion year ended December 31 2013 primarily driven growth Model S delivery worldwide . Gross margin year ended December 31 2014 27.6 significant increase 22.7 year ended December 31 2013 . Higher vehicle production volume supply chain efficiency component cost reduction partially offset onetime manufacturing inefficiency associated transitioning new final assembly line introduction AllWheel Drive Dual Motor Model S contributed higher gross margin 2014 . Research development RD expense year ended December 31 2014 464.7 million increase 232.0 million year ended December 31 2013 . RD expense 2014 reflected engineering work Model X well development work dual motor powertrain development program including localization effort foreign market . RD expense 2013 reflected activity manufacturing process improvement Model S cost reduction righthand drive Model S localization effort foreign market well development work Model X . During 2014 significantly increased sale service footprint worldwide entered several new market including China well accelerated rollout Supercharging network . With continued global expansion customer support infrastructure business general 2014 selling general administrative expense 603.7 million year ended December 31 2014 compared 285.6 million year ended December 31 2013 . Management Opportunities Challenges Risks Orders Production Deliveries Our order Model S 2014 significantly increased prior year expanded operation internationally introduced Model S product enhancement . In October 2014 revealed AllWheel Drive Dual Motor Model S Autopilot system . This version Model S proved popular leading 10000 unfulfilled order January 1 2015 . We expect demand Model S continue increase worldwide people drive become aware vehicle grow customer support infrastructure broaden appeal product . As December 31 2014 received almost 20000 reservation Model X advance planned introduction later year . We continuing test Beta Model X prototype plan begin building testing small fleet release candidate Model X vehicle later first quarter 2015 . Our ability launch Model X program time cost efficiently dependent upon variety factor including completion production tooling supplier readiness engineering completion successful completion validation testing .

We expect annual production increase 50 year next several year . 47 Our recent production capacity expansion contributed several week production excess 1000 vehicle per week last month 2014 . However changeover new final assembly line third quarter 2014 introduction AllWheel Drive Dual Motor Model S onto line fourth quarter 2014 took longer expected . Consequently delivered fewer vehicle planned 2014 . During 2015 plan achieve significant efficiency Model S production begin production Model X intent achieving significantly faster initial production ramp achieved Model S. Any unexpected issue expansion production capacity launch ramp Model X production could affect ability meet future delivery target . In addition expanding production expect continue lower cost manufacturing vehicle improve gross margin . Significant cost improvement Model S achieved 2013 2014 including part cost reduction well manufacturing efficiency . We expect trend continue execute roadmap . We expect improvement combined favorable mix vehicle allow u achieve 30 gross margin Model S end 2015 assuming deterioration foreign currency . However expect cost improvement partially offset production inefficiency introduction Model X . During product introduction 2014 incurred manufacturing inefficiency negatively impacted gross margin . When introduce Model X expect production inefficiency supply chain inefficiency typical new product introduction suppress Model X margin least quarter introduction . If able achieve planned cost reduction various cost saving process improvement initiative introduce Model X efficiently ability reach gross margin goal would negatively affected . We expect deliver approximately 55000 Model S X vehicle worldwide 2015 approximately 74 delivery achieved 2014 .
