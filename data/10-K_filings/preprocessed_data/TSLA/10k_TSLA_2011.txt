Automobile Manufacturer Dealer Regulation State law regulates manufacture distribution sale automobile generally requires motor vehicle manufacturer dealer licensed . To extent possible plan secure dealer license equivalent dealer license engage activity motor vehicle dealer far permitted open additional Tesla store . Some state permit automobile manufacturer licensed 22 Table Contents dealer act capacity dealer . To sell vehicle resident state licensed dealer extent permitted local law actual sale activity related sale would generally occur state . In scenario possible activity related marketing advertising taking order taking reservation reservation payment delivering vehicle could viewed state conducting unlicensed activity state otherwise violating state motor vehicle industry law . Regulators state may require u hold meet requirement appropriate dealer license state manufacturer prohibited acting dealer may otherwise prohibit impact planned activity . In jurisdiction Tesla store customer may try purchase vehicle internet . However state Kansas law providing manufacturer deliver vehicle resident state except dealer licensed business state may interpreted require u open store state Kansas order sell vehicle Kansas resident . Such law may interpreted require u open store state sell vehicle resident state . In state opened viewing gallery full retail location possible state regulator could take position activity gallery constitute unlicensed motor vehicle dealership thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer law . Although would prefer state regulator address concern discussing concern u requesting voluntary compliance state could also take action u including levying fine requiring refrain certain activity . In addition state requirement service facility available respect vehicle sold state may interpreted also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet resident state thereby limiting ability sell vehicle state maintain service facility . The foregoing example state law governing sale motor vehicle regulation face sell vehicle . In many state application state motor vehicle law specific sale model largely without precedent particularly respect sale internet would determined fact specific analysis numerous factor including whether physical presence employee applicable state whether advertise conduct activity applicable state sale transaction structured volume sale state whether state question prohibits manufacturer acting dealer . As result fact specific untested nature issue fact applying law intended traditional automobile distribution model sale model allows interpretation discretion regulator state legal prohibition may prevent u selling consumer state . California law potentially law state restrict ability licensed dealer advertise take deposit vehicle available . In November 2007 became aware New Motor Vehicle Board California Department Transportation considered whether reservation advertising policy comply law . To date received communication topic New Motor Vehicle Board Department Motor Vehicles DMV power enforce law . There assurance DMV take position vehicle reservation advertising practice violate law . We expect DMV determines may violated law would initially discus concern u request voluntary compliance . If ultimately found violation California law might precluded taking reservation payment DMV could take action u including levying fine requiring u refund reservation payment . Resolution inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspect reservation program . The DMV also power suspend license manufacture sell vehicle California following hearing merit typically exercised case significant repeat violation andor refusal comply DMV direction . Certain state may specific law apply dealer manufacturer selling directly consumer . For example state Washington requires reservation payment payment 23 Table Contents received resident state Washington must placed segregated account delivery vehicle account must unencumbered lien creditor dealer may used dealer . Consequently established segregated account reservation payment state Washington January 2010 . There assurance state foreign jurisdiction require similar segregation reservation payment received customer . Our inability access fund working capital purpose could harm liquidity . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . In addition licensing law specific law regulation state interpretation regulator may limit determine sell market advertise otherwise solicit sale take order take reservation reservation payment deliver service vehicle consumer engage activity state . While performed analysis law certain jurisdiction Tesla store performed complete analysis jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Competition Competition automotive industry intense evolving .

At time plan hold reservation payment separately escrow trust fund pay interest reservation payment except extent applicable state law require u . We generally use fund working capital general corporate purpose . California law potentially law state restrict ability licensed auto dealer advertise take deposit vehicle vehicle available dealer manufacturer . In November 2007 became aware New Motor Vehicle Board California Department Transportation considered whether reservation policy advertising comply California Vehicle Code . To date received communication topic New Motor Vehicle Board Department Motor Vehicles DMV power enforce law . There assurance DMV take position vehicle reservation advertising practice violate law . We expect DMV determines may violated law would initially discus concern u request voluntary compliance . If ultimately found violation California law might precluded taking reservation payment DMV could take action u including levying fine requiring u refund reservation payment . Resolution inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspect reservation program . In addition California currently jurisdiction license manufacture sell vehicle limitation imposed operation California may particularly damaging business . The DMV also power suspend license manufacture sell vehicle California following hearing merit typically exercised case significant repeat violation andor refusal comply DMV direction . Certain state may specific law apply reservation payment accepted dealer manufacturer selling directly consumer . For example state Washington requires reservation payment payment received resident state Washington must placed segregated account delivery vehicle account must unencumbered lien creditor dealer may used dealer . Consequently established segregated account reservation payment state Washington January 2010 . There assurance state foreign jurisdiction require similar segregation reservation payment received customer . Our inability access fund working capital purpose could harm liquidity . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . If vehicle reservation advertising practice business practice found violate law jurisdiction may face exposure law business prospect would adversely affected . For example required return reservation payment amount may need raise additional fund make payment . There assurance funding would available timely basis commercially reasonable term . If court 50 Table Contents find reservation agreement advertising comply state law may face exposure law may include exposure consumer protection statute deal unfair competition false advertising . Moreover reduction cash result redemption inability take reservation payment could also make difficult u obtain additional financing .

If fail successfully address risk business prospect operating result financial condition could materially harmed . Foreign currency movement relative U.S. dollar could harm financial result . Our revenue cost denominated foreign currency completely matched . For example portion cost expense year ended December 31 2011 denominated foreign currency principally British pound . This primarily due contract Lotus United Kingdom assemble Tesla Roadster vehicle glider . If value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly British pound cost measured U.S. dollar correspondingly increase . Similarly weakening U.S. dollar Japanese yen another Asian currency could cause component cost increase . However currently sufficient revenue denominated currency fully offset impact cost increase . As result operating result could adversely affected . Conversely greater revenue cost denominated currency principally euro . In case strengthening dollar euro current level would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar .

This could materially adversely affect growth alternative fuel automobile market business prospect financial condition operating result . Our growth depends part availability amount government subsidy economic incentive alternative fuel vehicle generally performance electric vehicle specifically . For example December 2009 finalized arrangement California Alternative Energy Advanced Transportation Financing Authority result exemption California state sale use tax 320 million manufacturing equipment . To extent equipment purchased would otherwise subject California state sale use tax believe incentive would result tax saving u approximately 31 million three year period starting December 2009 . This exemption available equipment would otherwise subject California sale use tax would used following three purpose establish production facility Model S sedan upgrade Palo Alto powertrain production facility expand current Tesla Roadster assembly operation Menlo Park facility . If fail meet condition would unable take full advantage tax incentive financial position could harmed . 52 Table Contents In addition certain regulation law encourage sale electric car tax credit subsidy could reduced eliminated applied way creates adverse effect vehicle either currently time future . For example federal state government time time enacted tax credit incentive purchase alternative fuel car competitor experience greater resource working legislator guarantee vehicle would eligible tax credit incentive provided alternative fuel vehicle future . This would put vehicle competitive disadvantage . As example state level California recently renewed rebate program purchase qualified alternative technology vehicle reduced rebate amount 5000 per vehicle 2500 per vehicle due fewer fund available increased demand . When fund run mechanism place replenish next fiscal year . Subsequent purchaser would face delay receiving rebate since would wait next fiscal year funding became available . As additional example considerable discussion federal level tax reform . Discussions included reducing even eliminating current 7500 tax credit available purchaser qualified alternative fuel vehicle including Tesla Roadster Model S. Also government disincentive enacted Europe gaspowered vehicle discourage use vehicle allow u set higher sale price Tesla Roadster Europe . In event disincentive reduced eliminated sale electric vehicle including Tesla Roadster Model S could adversely affected . Furthermore low volume manufacturer exempt certain regulatory requirement United States European Union . This provides u advantage high volume manufacturer must comply regulation .
