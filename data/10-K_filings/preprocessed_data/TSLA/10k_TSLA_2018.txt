However timeframe commencing Model 3 production Gigafactory Shanghai subject number uncertainty including regulatory approval supply chain constraint pace installing production equipment bringing factory online . 16 We limited experience date manufacturing vehicle high volume recently achieved anticipate ramping Model 3 successful need complete implementation ramp efficient costeffective manufacturing capability process supply chain necessary support volume including Gigafactory Shanghai . We employing higher degree automation manufacturing process Model 3 previously employed continue implement additional automation . In case temporarily reduced level automation introduced semiautomated manual process additional labor cost . Additional bottleneck may also arise continue ramp production Tesla Factory commence initial phase Model 3 production Gigafactory Shanghai important address promptly costeffective manner . Moreover Model 3 production plan generally required date significant investment cash management resource expect deploy level additional resource progress ramp begin production new location future China . Our production plan Model 3 based many key assumption including able sustain expand highvolume production Model 3 Tesla Factory without exceeding projected cost projected timeline able continue expand Gigafactory 1 timely manner produce high volume quality lithiumion cell integrated battery module finished battery pack drive unit component Model 3 including part support production China level local sourcing manufacturing progressively increase cost allow u sell Model 3 target gross margin able build commence production additional future facility Gigafactory Shanghai support international ramp Model 3 accordance projected cost timeline equipment process selected Model 3 production able accurately manufacture high volume Model 3 vehicle within specified design tolerance high quality able maintain supplier necessary component term condition acceptable u able obtain highquality component timely basis necessary quantity support highvolume production able attract recruit hire train retain skilled employee operate planned highvolume production facility support Model 3 including Tesla Factory Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory Shanghai . If one foregoing assumption turn incorrect ability meet Model 3 projection time volume price profitable demand delivery Model 3 well business prospect operating result financial condition may materially adversely impacted . We may unable meet growing vehicle production sale delivery plan servicing need could harm business prospect . Our plan call sustaining ramping significant increase vehicle production delivery particularly Model 3 . Our ability achieve plan depend upon number factor including ability utilize installed manufacturing capacity achieve planned production yield install increase capacity accordance planned timeline cost maintain desired quality level optimize design production change well supplier ability support need . In addition used may use future number new manufacturing technology technique process vehicle must successfully introduce scale highvolume production . For example introduced highly automated production line aluminum spot welding system highspeed blow forming certain difficult stamp vehicle part . We also introduced unique design feature vehicle different manufacturing challenge large display screen dual motor drivetrain Autopilot hardware falconwing door . We limited experience developing manufacturing selling servicing allocating available resource among multiple product simultaneously . If unable realize plan brand business prospect financial condition operating result could materially damaged . 17 Concurrent increasing vehicle production level also need continue significantly increase sale delivery vehicle . Although plan selling delivering increased volume vehicle limited experience marketing selling delivering vehicle higher volume manufacturing Model 3 may face difficulty meeting sale delivery goal existing market well new market expand Europe China beginning deliver Model 3 first time first quarter 2019 . In particular targeting first time Model 3 mass demographic broad range potential customer limited experience projecting demand pricing product . While producing numerous variant including regional version Model 3 accordance demand expect projection inaccurate may able generate sale matched specific vehicle capacity produce based vehicle production line constraint long lead time procuring certain part . Moreover independent dealer network responsible delivering vehicle customer meeting vehicle servicing need . To date limited experience delivery servicing scale expect grow particularly international market . To accommodate volume deployed number delivery model delivery customer home workplace previously tested scale different geography . Moreover significant transit time may required transport vehicle Model 3 volume new market first time . To extent factor lead delay delivery result may negatively impacted . Finally unique expertise vehicle recommend vehicle serviced service center Mobile Service technician certain authorized professional specifically trained equipped . If experience delay adding servicing capacity experience unforeseen issue reliability Model 3 recently commenced producing volume could overburden servicing capability . If unable ramp meet sale delivery servicing target globally projection target based inaccurate could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . Our future growth success dependent upon consumer willingness adopt electric vehicle specifically vehicle especially mass market demographic targeting Model 3 . Our growth highly dependent upon adoption consumer alternative fuel vehicle general electric vehicle particular . Although successfully grown demand vehicle thus far guarantee future demand vehicle compete one another market . Moreover Model 3 mass market demographic larger competitive demographic Model S Model X additional electric vehicle entering market . If market electric vehicle general Tesla vehicle particular develop expect develops slowly expect demand vehicle decrease market business prospect financial condition operating result could harmed . We recently begun high volume production vehicle still earlier stage limited resource relative competitor market alternative fuel vehicle rapidly evolving . As result market vehicle could affected numerous factor perception electric vehicle feature quality safety performance cost perception limited range electric vehicle may driven single battery charge competition including type alternative fuel vehicle plugin hybrid electric vehicle high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility cost oil gasoline government regulation economic incentive access charging facility concern future viability . 18 We dependent supplier majority singlesource supplier inability supplier deliver necessary component product according schedule price quality level volume acceptable u inability efficiently manage component could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Our product contain numerous purchased part source globally hundred direct supplier majority currently singlesource supplier although attempt qualify obtain component multiple source whenever feasible . Any significant increase production may require u procure additional component short amount time past also replaced certain supplier failure provide component met quality control standard . While believe able secure additional alternate source supply component relatively short time frame assurance able develop replacement certain highly customized component product . Moreover signed longterm agreement Panasonic manufacturing partner supplier lithiumion cell Gigafactory 1 Nevada PV cell panel Gigafactory 2 Buffalo New York . If encounter unexpected difficulty key supplier Panasonic unable fill need supplier could experience production delay potential loss access important technology part producing servicing supporting product . This limited many case single source supply chain expose u multiple potential source delivery failure component shortage production product experienced 2012 2016 connection slowerthanplanned Model S Model X ramp . Furthermore unexpected change business condition material pricing labor issue war governmental change natural disaster March 2011 earthquake Japan factor beyond supplier control could also affect supplier ability deliver component u timely basis . The loss single limited source supplier disruption supply component supplier could lead product design change delay product delivery customer could hurt relationship customer result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . Changes supply chain also resulted past may result future increased cost . We also experienced cost increase certain supplier order meet quality target development timeline well due design change may experience similar cost increase future . Certain supplier sought renegotiate term supply arrangement . Additionally negotiating existing supplier cost reduction seeking new le expensive supplier certain part attempting redesign certain part make le expensive produce . If unsuccessful effort control reduce supplier cost operating result suffer . In particular producing Model 3 significantly higher volume product date negative impact delay constraint respect supplier Model 3 could substantially greater supply chainrelated issue experienced respect product . We need Model 3 supplier sustainably ramp accordance ongoing ramp Model 3 deliver according schedule . There assurance supplier ultimately able sustainably timely meet cost quality volume need . For example may experience issue delay increasing level localization China local sourcing manufacturing Gigafactory Shanghai . Furthermore scale vehicle production increase need accurately forecast purchase warehouse transport manufacturing facility component much higher volume . If unable accurately match timing quantity component purchase actual need successfully implement automation inventory management system accommodate increased complexity supply chain may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation writeoff cost could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . 19 Future problem delay expanding Gigafactory 1 ramping operation could negatively affect production profitability product Model 3 energy storage product .

While Gigafactory 1 began producing lithiumion cell energy storage product January 2017 since begun producing lithiumion cell Model 3 direct experience production lithiumion cell . Given size complexity undertaking possible future event could result issue delay ramping expanding production Gigafactory 1 . Moreover expect need additional production Gigafactory 1 support vehicle production Gigafactory Shanghai part commence Model 3 production . In order achieve volume gross margin target Model 3 anticipated ramp production energy storage product must continue sustain ramp significant cell production Gigafactory 1 among thing requires Panasonic successfully operate ramp cell production line significant volume . Although Panasonic long track record producing highquality cell significant volume factory Japan limited experience cell production Gigafactory 1 . In addition produce several component Model 3 battery module incorporating lithiumion cell produced Panasonic drive unit Gigafactory 1 . Some manufacturing line component took longer anticipated ramp full capacity . While largely overcome bottleneck deploying multiple semiautomated line improving original line additional bottleneck may arise continue increase production rate . Finally announced likely manufacture Model Y Gigafactory 1 . If unable maintain Gigafactory 1 production ramp additionally time needed costeffectively Panasonic unable attract hire retain substantial number highly skilled personnel ability supply battery pack component Model 3 product could negatively impacted could negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . If vehicle product sell install fail perform expected ability develop market sell product service could harmed . If vehicle energy product contain defect design manufacture cause perform expected require repair certain feature vehicle full selfdriving take longer expected become enabled legally restricted ability develop market sell product service could harmed . For example operation vehicle highly dependent software inherently complex may contain latent defect error subject external attack . Issues experienced vehicle customer included related software 17 inch display screen panoramic roof 12volt battery Model S seat door Model X . Although attempt remedy issue observe product effectively rapidly possible effort may timely may hamper production may satisfaction customer . While performed extensive internal testing product manufacture currently limited frame reference evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability performance characteristic battery pack powertrains vehicle energy storage product . There assurance able detect fix defect product prior sale installation consumer . Any product defect delay legal restriction product feature failure product perform expected could harm reputation result delivery delay product recall product liability claim significant warranty expense could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . 20 If fail scale business operation otherwise manage future growth adapt new condition effectively rapidly grow company including internationally may able produce market sell service product successfully . Any failure manage growth effectively could materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . We expect continue expand operation significantly including internationally increasing production Model 3 worldwide sale delivery servicing significantly higher number vehicle current vehicle fleet coming year . Furthermore developing growing energy storage product solar business worldwide including country limited previous operating experience . Our future operating result depend large extent ability manage expansion growth successfully . We may successful undertaking global expansion unable control expense avoid cost overrun unexpected operating cost establish sufficient worldwide automobile sale delivery service Supercharger facility timely manner adapt product conduct operation meet local requirement implement required local infrastructure system process find hire significant number additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction administrative personnel . In particular plan expand manufacturing capability outside U.S. limited experience operating factory managing related regulatory financing challenge . For example part continuing work increase Model 3 production 10000 vehicle per week sustained basis make Model 3 affordable market plan offer expect commence initial phase Model 3 production Gigafactory Shanghai local market China end 2019 although timeframe subject number uncertainty including regulatory approval supply chain constraint pace installing production equipment bringing factory online . As expect commence manufacturing activity China using progressively increased level localization local sourcing manufacturing expect need initially support manufacturing activity production process existing manufacturing facility Gigafactory 1 . Moreover local manufacturing critical expansion sale China largest market electric vehicle world . Our sale Model S Model X China negatively impacted certain tariff automobile manufactured U.S. vehicle cost producing vehicle U.S. also affected import duty certain component sourced China . If able establish manufacturing activity China jurisdiction minimize impact unfavorable tariff duty cost ramp production capability Gigafactory 1 facility support vehicle manufacturing activity ability compete jurisdiction operating result business prospect harmed . If unable achieve targeted manufacturing cost vehicle including Model 3 financial condition operating result suffer . While continuing expect future realize cost reduction u supplier guarantee able achieve sufficient cost saving reach gross margin profitability goal including least expensive variant Model 3 ultimately expect produce financial target . We incur significant cost related procuring material required manufacture vehicle assembling vehicle compensating personnel . If effort continue decrease manufacturing cost successful may incur substantial cost cost overrun utilizing increasing production capability vehicle manufacturing facility Model 3 U.S. internationally . Many factor impact manufacturing cost beyond control potential increase cost material component lithium nickel component battery cell aluminum used produce body panel . If unable continue control reduce manufacturing cost operating result business prospect harmed . 21 Increases cost disruption supply shortage material particular lithiumion cell could harm business . We may experience increase cost sustained interruption supply shortage material . Any increase supply interruption shortage could materially negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We use various material business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper cobalt well lithiumion cell supplier . The price material fluctuate available supply may unstable depending market condition global demand material including result increased production electric vehicle energy storage product competitor could adversely affect business operating result . For instance exposed multiple risk relating lithiumion cell . These risk include increase cost decrease available supply material used cell disruption supply cell due quality issue recall battery cell manufacturer issue may arise respect cell manufactured facility fluctuation value Japanese yen U.S. dollar batterycell purchase Model S Model X raw material cell used Model 3 energy storage product currently denominated Japanese yen . Our business dependent continued supply battery cell battery pack used vehicle energy storage product . While believe several source battery cell available battery pack expect eventually rely substantially battery cell manufactured facility date fully qualified limited number supplier cell used battery pack limited flexibility changing cell supplier . Any disruption supply battery cell supplier could disrupt production vehicle battery pack produce energy product time different supplier fully qualified . Furthermore fluctuation shortage petroleum economic condition may cause u experience significant increase freight charge material cost . Substantial increase price material price charged u charged battery cell supplier would increase operating cost could reduce margin recoup increased cost increased vehicle price . Any attempt increase vehicle price response increased material cost could result cancellation vehicle order reservation therefore materially adversely affect brand image business prospect operating result . We may become subject product liability claim could harm financial condition liquidity able successfully defend insure claim . Although design vehicle safest vehicle road product liability claim even without merit could harm business prospect operating result financial condition . The automobile industry particular experience significant product liability claim face inherent risk exposure claim event vehicle perform claimed performed expected . As true automaker car involved expect future involved crash resulting death personal injury crash Autopilot engaged subject significant public attention . We experienced expect continue face claim arising related misuse claimed failure new technology pioneering including Autopilot vehicle . Moreover solar energy system energy storage product generate store electricity potential cause injury people property . A successful product liability claim u could require u pay substantial monetary award . Our risk area particularly pronounced given relatively limited number vehicle energy storage product delivered date limited field experience product . Moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity product business could material adverse effect brand business prospect operating result . In jurisdiction generally selfinsure risk product liability claim vehicle exposure meaning product liability claim likely paid company fund insurance . 22 The market operate highly competitive may successful competing industry . We currently face competition new established domestic international competitor expect face competition others future including competition company new technology . The worldwide automotive market particularly alternative fuel vehicle highly competitive today expect become even future . There assurance vehicle successful respective market compete . A significant growing number established new automobile manufacturer well company entered reported plan enter alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid fully electric vehicle well market selfdriving technology application . In case competitor announced intention produce electric vehicle exclusively point future . Most current potential competitor significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sale resource network may able devote greater resource design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale support product . In particular competitor also announced plan compete u important large market electric vehicle China . Increased competition could result lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss customer loss market share could harm business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition Model 3 vehicle face competition existing future automobile manufacturer extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan market including Audi BMW Lexus Mercedes . The solar energy storage industry highly competitive . We face competition manufacturer developer installers solar energy storage system well large utility . Decreases retail price electricity utility renewable energy source could make product le attractive customer lead increased rate customer default existing longterm lease PPAs . Moreover solar panel lithiumion battery price declined continuing decline . As increase battery solar manufacturing capability including Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory 2 future price decline may harm ability produce energy storage system solar system competitive price . If unable establish maintain confidence longterm business prospect among consumer analyst within industry financial condition operating result business prospect stock price may suffer materially . Consumers may le likely purchase product convinced business succeed service support operation continue long term . Similarly supplier third party le likely invest time resource developing business relationship u convinced business succeed . Accordingly order build maintain business must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst rating agency party longterm financial viability business prospect . Maintaining confidence may particularly complicated certain factor limited operating history negative press customer unfamiliarity product delay scaling manufacturing delivery service operation meet demand competition uncertainty regarding future electric vehicle product service quarterly production sale performance compared market expectation negative publicity related u . Many factor largely outside control negative perception longterm business prospect even exaggerated unfounded speculation regarding sufficiency stability management team could harm business make difficult raise additional fund needed . 23 Our plan generate ongoing growth demand including expanding optimizing retail service vehicle charging operation require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale installation servicing product availability public charging solution . We plan generate ongoing growth demand including globally expanding optimizing retail service vehicle charging operation . These plan require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale installation product . This ongoing global expansion includes planned entry market limited experience selling delivering installing andor servicing product scale may pose legal regulatory labor cultural political challenge previously encountered may desired effect increasing sale installation expanding brand presence degree anticipating . Furthermore increasing number Tesla vehicle require u continue increase number Supercharger station connector significantly location throughout world . If fail timely manner customer could become dissatisfied could adversely affect sale vehicle . We also need ensure compliance regulatory requirement applicable sale installation service product sale electricity generated solar energy system operation Superchargers jurisdiction could take considerable time expense . If experience delay meet customer expectation expanding customer infrastructure network expansion plan successful continuing grow demand could lead decrease stagnation sale installation product could negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We face risk associated global operation expansion including unfavorable regulatory political economic tax labor condition establishing new market could harm business . We currently global footprint domestic international operation subsidiary various country jurisdiction continue expand optimize retail service Supercharger capability internationally . Accordingly subject variety legal political regulatory requirement social economic condition little control . For example may impacted trade policy political uncertainty economic cycle involving geographic region significant operation . Sales vehicle automotive industry also tend cyclical many market may expose u increased volatility expand adjust operation retail strategy . We subject number risk associated particular international business activity may increase cost impact ability sell product require significant management attention . These risk include conforming product various international regulatory safety requirement well charging electric infrastructure organizing local operating entity difficulty establishing staffing managing foreign operation challenge attracting customer foreign government tax regulation permit requirement ability enforce contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff price exchange control preference foreign nation domestically manufactured product . For example China key market u certain product automobile manufactured U.S. become subject recently increased tariff imposed government . While increase temporarily suspended tariff could remain place undetermined length time increased future andor lead consumer postpone choose another vehicle brand subject lower tariff tariff . Moreover recently increased import duty certain component used product sourced China may increase cost negatively impact operating result . 24 Our vehicle energy storage product make use lithiumion battery cell observed catch fire vent smoke flame event raised concern future event may lead additional concern battery used automotive application . The battery pack produce make use lithiumion cell . On rare occasion lithiumion cell rapidly release energy contain venting smoke flame manner ignite nearby material well lithiumion cell . While designed battery pack passively contain single cell release energy without spreading neighboring cell assurance field testing failure vehicle battery pack produce occur could subject u lawsuit product recall redesign effort would time consuming expensive . Also negative public perception regarding suitability lithiumion cell automotive application future incident involving lithiumion cell vehicle fire even incident involve vehicle energy storage product could seriously harm business . In addition store significant number lithiumion cell facility producing high volume cell battery module pack Gigafactory 1 . Any mishandling battery cell may cause disruption operation facility . While implemented safety procedure related handling cell assurance safety issue fire related cell would disrupt operation . Such damage injury could lead adverse publicity potentially safety recall . Moreover failure competitor electric vehicle energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity u product . Such adverse publicity could negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . If fail effectively grow manage residual financing credit risk related vehicle financing program business may suffer . We offer financing arrangement vehicle North America Europe Asia primarily various financial institution . We also currently offer Model S Model X leasing directly local subsidiary U.S. Canada . Under lease held directly u typically receive small portion total vehicle purchase price time lease followed stream payment term lease . The profitability vehicle returned u end lease depends ability accurately project vehicle residual value outset lease value may fluctuate prior end term depending various factor supply demand used vehicle economic cycle pricing new vehicle . The leasing program also relies ability secure adequate financing andor business partner fund grow program screen manage customer credit risk . We expect availability leasing financing option important vehicle customer . If unable adequately fund leasing program internal fund partner external financing source compelling alternative financing program available customer may unable grow sale . Furthermore leasing business grows substantially business may suffer effectively manage greater level residual credit risk resulting growth . Finally successfully monitor comply applicable national state andor local financial regulation consumer protection law governing lease transaction may become subject enforcement action penalty either may harm business . Moreover provided resale value guarantee customer partner certain financing program counterparties may sell vehicle back u certain point time predetermined amount . However actual resale value residual value leased vehicle subject similar fluctuation term financing arrangement . If actual resale value vehicle resold returned u pursuant program materially lower predetermined amount offered operating result profitability andor liquidity could negatively impacted . 25 The unavailability reduction elimination unfavorable determination respect government economic incentive U.S. abroad supporting development adoption electric vehicle energy storage product solar energy could impact demand product service . We customer currently benefit certain government economic incentive supporting development adoption electric vehicle . In U.S. abroad incentive include among thing tax credit rebate encourage purchase electric vehicle . In Norway example purchase electric vehicle currently subject import tax 25 value added tax carbon dioxide weightbased purchase tax apply purchase gaspowered vehicle . Notably quantum incentive program promoting electric vehicle tiny fraction amount subsidy provided gaspowered vehicle oil gas industry . Nevertheless even limited benefit program could reduced eliminated exhausted . For example current regulation 7500 federal tax credit available U.S. purchase vehicle reduced phase sunset end 2019 . We believe first reduction tax credit may pulled forward nearterm demand U.S. 2018 could create similar pullforwards 2019 step reduction federal tax credit . Moreover July 2018 previously available incentive purchase Model 3 Ontario Canada cancelled Tesla buyer Germany lost access electric vehicle incentive short period time beginning late 2017 . In April 2017 January 2016 respectively previously available incentive Hong Kong Denmark favored purchase electric vehicle expired negatively impacting sale . Effective March 2016 California implemented regulation phasing 2500 cash rebate qualified electric vehicle highincome consumer . Such development could negative impact demand vehicle customer may adjust . In addition certain governmental rebate tax credit financial incentive currently available respect solar energy storage product business allow u lower installation cost cost capital encourage customer buy product investor invest solar financing fund . However incentive may expire particular date allocated funding exhausted reduced terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase often without warning . For example U.S. federal government currently offer 30 ITC installation solar power facility energy storage system charged cosited solar power facility . The ITC currently scheduled decline phase ultimately 10 commercial utility system 0 customerowned residential system January 2022 . Likewise jurisdiction net energy metering currently available customer receive bill credit utility energy solar energy system generate export grid excess electric load use . Several jurisdiction reduced eliminated benefit available net energy metering proposed . Such reduction termination governmental incentive could adversely impact result making product le competitive potential customer increasing cost capital adversely impacting ability attract investment partner form new financing fund solar energy storage asset . Additionally enactment Tax Cuts Jobs Act U.S. could potentially increase cost decrease availability renewable energy financing reducing value depreciation benefit associated overall investor tax capacity needed monetize renewable energy project . Such change could lower overall investment willingness capacity project available market . Moreover fund investor claim ITC certain state incentive amount based fair market value solar energy storage system . Although obtain independent appraisal support claimed fair market value relevant governmental authority audited value certain case determined lower may future . Such determination may result adverse tax consequence andor obligation make indemnification payment fund fund investor . 26 Any failure u realize expected benefit substantial investment commitment respect manufacture PV cell module including unable comply term agreement Research Foundation State University New York relating Gigafactory 2 could result negative consequence business . We certain PV cell module manufacturing technology asset buildtosuit lease arrangement Research Foundation State University New York SUNY Foundation . This agreement SUNY Foundation provides construction Gigafactory 2 Buffalo New York intended capacity produce least 1.0 GW solar product annually . Under agreement obligated among thing employ specified minimum number personnel State New York spend incur 5.0 billion combined capital operational expense cost good sold cost State New York 10year period following completion construction related infrastructure arrival manufacturing equipment receipt certain permit specified item Gigafactory 2 . If fail year course term agreement meet obligation would obligated pay program payment 41.2 million SUNY Foundation year . Any inability part comply requirement agreement may result payment significant amount SUNY Foundation termination lease Gigafactory 2 andor need secure alternative supply PV cell module solar product . Moreover unable utilize manufacturing technology asset accordance expectation may recognize accounting charge pertaining writeoff asset .

None key employee bound employment agreement specific term may able successfully attract retain senior leadership necessary grow business . Our future success depends upon ability attract retain executive officer key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing support personnel especially support highvolume manufacture vehicle expansion plan failure delay could adversely impact business prospect financial condition operating result . Key talent may leave Tesla due various factor competitive labor market talented individual automotive technology experience negative publicity related u . In California Nevada region operation increasing competition individual skillsets needed business including specialized knowledge electric vehicle software engineering manufacturing engineering skill electrical building construction expertise . This competition affect ability retain key employee hire new one . Moreover past conducted reduction force order optimize organizational structure reduce cost certain senior personnel also departed various reason . Our continued success depends upon continued ability hire new employee timely manner especially support expansion plan retain current employee replace departed senior employee qualified experienced individual typically timeconsuming process . Additionally compete mature prosperous company far greater financial resource startup emerging company promise shortterm growth opportunity . Difficulties retaining current employee recruiting new one could adverse effect performance result . 27 Finally compensation philosophy personnel reflects startup origin emphasis equitybased award benefit order closely align incentive longterm interest stockholder . Each current equity incentive plan employee stock purchase plan provides evergreen provision permit board director increase annual basis subject specified limit number equitybased award may granted share common stock may purchased personnel thereunder . These plan currently scheduled expire December 2019 need extend establish new plan order continue compensate employee following expiration require approval stockholder . Moreover assurance plan extended future plan contain evergreen provision would mean would periodically seek obtain approval stockholder future increase number award may granted share may purchased plan . If unable obtain stockholder approval compensate personnel accordance compensation philosophy ability retain hire qualified personnel would negatively impacted . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer largest stockholder .

Our business may adversely affected disruption caused union activity . It common employee company significant manufacturing operation u belong union result higher employee cost increased risk work stoppage . Moreover regulation jurisdiction outside U.S. mandate employee participation industrial collective bargaining agreement work council certain consultation right respect relevant company operation . Although work diligently provide best possible work environment employee may still decide join seek recognition form labor union may required become union signatory . The United Automobile Workers UAW engaged campaign organize manufacturing operation Tesla . As part campaign UAW filed National Labor Relations Board NLRB series unfair labor practice charge Tesla hearing recently concluded . We predict timing NLRBs decision unfavorable outcome Tesla may negative impact perception Teslas treatment employee . Furthermore directly indirectly dependent upon company unionized work force part supplier trucking freight company work stoppage strike organized union could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result . If work stoppage occurs could delay manufacture sale product material adverse effect business prospect operating result financial condition . 29 Our product service subject substantial regulation evolving unfavorable change failure u comply regulation could substantially harm business operating result . Motor vehicle subject substantial regulation international federal state local law . We incur significant cost complying regulation may required incur additional cost comply change regulation failure comply could result significant expense delay fine . We subject law regulation applicable supply manufacture import sale service automobile internationally . For example country outside U.S. required meet standard relating vehicle safety fuel economy emission among thing often materially different requirement U.S. thus resulting additional investment vehicle system ensure regulatory compliance country . This process may include official review certification vehicle foreign regulatory agency prior market entry well compliance foreign reporting recall management system requirement . Additionally vehicle equipped suite driverassistance feature called Autopilot help assist driver certain tedious potentially dangerous aspect road travel require driver remain engaged . There variety international federal state regulation may apply selfdriving vehicle include many existing vehicle standard originally intended apply vehicle may driver . Such regulation continue rapidly change increase likelihood patchwork complex conflicting regulation may delay product restrict selfdriving feature availability could adversely affect business . Moreover manufacturer installer solar generation energy storage system supplier electricity generated stored solar energy energy storage system install customer impacted federal state local regulation policy concerning electricity pricing interconnection electricity generation storage equipment electric grid sale electricity generated thirdparty owned system . For example existing proposed regulation policy would permit utility limit amount electricity generated customer solar energy system charge fee penalty customer relating purchase energy grid adjust electricity rate design price solar product may competitive electricity grid restrict u customer transacting PPAs qualifying government incentive benefit apply solar power limit eliminate net energy metering . If regulation policy remain effect adopted jurisdiction regulation policy adversely impact interconnection use solar energy storage system introduced could deter potential customer purchasing solar energy storage product threaten economics existing contract cause u cease solar energy storage system sale operation relevant jurisdiction could harm business prospect financial condition result operation . Failure comply various privacy consumer protection law subject could harm Company . Our privacy policy posted website failure u vendor business partner comply federal state international privacy data protection security law regulation could result regulatory litigationrelated action u legal liability fine damage cost . Substantial expense operational change may required connection maintaining compliance law particular certain emerging privacy law still subject high degree uncertainty interpretation application . For example May 2018 General Data Protection Regulation GDPR began fully apply processing personal information collected individual located European Union . The GDPR created new compliance obligation significantly increased fine noncompliance . Although take step protect security customer personal information may required expend significant resource comply data breach requirement third party improperly obtain use personal information customer otherwise experience data loss respect customer personal information . A major breach network security system could negative consequence business future prospect including possible fine penalty damage reduced customer demand vehicle harm reputation brand . 30 We may choose compelled undertake product recall take similar action could adversely affect brand image financial performance . Any product recall respect product may result adverse publicity damage brand adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . For example certain vehicle recall initiated resulted various cause including component could prevent parking brake releasing engaged concern firmware restraint control module certain righthanddrive vehicle industrywide issue airbags particular supplier Model X seat component could cause unintended seat movement collision concern corrosion Model S power steering assist motor bolt . Furthermore testing product government regulator industry group may require u initiate product recall may result negative public perception safety product . In future may various time voluntarily involuntarily initiate recall product electric vehicle powertrain component provided vehicle OEMs including system part sourced supplier prove defective noncompliant applicable law regulation federal motor vehicle safety standard . Such recall whether voluntary involuntary caused system component engineered manufactured u supplier could involve significant expense could adversely affect brand image target market well business prospect financial condition result operation . Our current future warranty reserve may insufficient cover future warranty claim could adversely affect financial performance .

The limited warranty battery drive unit new Model S Model X vehicle cover drive unit eight year well battery period eight year certain older vehicle 125000 mile reached sooner eight year although battery charging capacity covered warranty Extended Service plan limited warranty used Model S Model X vehicle extend otherwise alter term original battery drive unit limited warranty used vehicle specified original New Vehicle Limited Warranty . For battery drive unit current new Model 3 vehicle offer eightyear 100000mile limited warranty standard midrange battery eightyear 120000mile limited warranty longrange battery minimum 70 retention battery capacity warranty period . In addition customer new Model S Model X vehicle opportunity purchase Extended Service plan period end limited warranty new vehicle cover additional service additional four year 50000 mile . For energy storage product provide limited warranty defect guarantee minimum energy retention level . For example currently guarantee Powerwall 2 product maintain least 70 80 depending region installation stated energy capacity 10 year Powerpack 2 product retain specified minimum energy capacity first 15 year use . For Solar Roof currently offer warranty glass tile lifetime customer home separate warranty energy generation capability solar tile . We also offer extended warranty availability guarantee capacity guarantee period 20 year additional cost time purchase well workmanship warranty customer elect u install system . Finally customer lease solar energy system lease buy energy u PPAs covered warranty equal length agreement term typically 20 year . Systems purchased cash covered workmanship warranty 20 year . In addition pas customer inverter panel manufacturer warranty generally range 10 25 year . Finally provide performance guarantee leased solar energy system compensates customer annual basis system meet electricity production guarantee set forth lease . Under performance guarantee bear risk production shortfall resulting inverter panel failure . These risk exacerbated event panel inverter manufacturer cease operation fail honor warranty . 31 If warranty reserve inadequate cover future warranty claim product business prospect financial condition operating result could materially adversely affected . Warranty reserve include management best estimate projected cost repair replace item warranty . These estimate based actual claim incurred todate estimate nature frequency cost future claim . Such estimate inherently uncertain change historical projected experience especially respect product Model 3 Solar Roof recently introduced andor expect produce significantly greater volume past product may cause material change warranty reserve future .

Management Opportunities Challenges Risks 2019 Outlook Automotive Demand Production Deliveries Our goal produce world highest quality vehicle quickly costeffectively possible priority workplace health safety . The worldwide automotive market alternative fuel vehicle selfdriving technology highly competitive expect become even . A growing number company including established automaker announced plan expand case fully transition production electric environmentally friendly vehicle andor develop selfdriving technology . However believe unique feature vehicle safety aspect vehicle constant innovation growing brand increased affordability introduced Model 3 innovation expansion global retail service charging operation infrastructure future vehicle continue generate incremental demand vehicle making vehicle accessible larger previously untapped consumer commercial market . 42 Model 3 bestselling premium vehicle United States 2018 . Vehicles traded u Model 3 customer continue suggest existence wider addressable market vehicle existing owner midsized premium sedan . Moreover offered longrange midrange performance variant Model 3 thus far believe see increased demand introduction le expensive variant version base price 35000 intend offer future additional financing option . We commenced January 2019 production Model 3 Europe China believe much larger midsized premium sedan market North America exclusively delivered Model 3 date . We also believe advantage competitor respect battery powertrain technology vehicle EPArated range per kWh expected superior electric vehicle introduced near term ability improve vehicle overtheair software update . We producing variant including regional version Model 3 accordance demand expect however finite production capability long lead time associated procuring certain part . If Model 3 demand expectation prove inaccurate experience delay introducing planned additional variant including begin offering Model 3 new market may able timely generate sale matched specific vehicle capacity produce . We may also impacted trade policy political uncertainty economic cycle involving geographic region significant operation . Sales vehicle automotive industry also tend cyclical many market may expose u increased volatility expand adjust operation retail strategy . In addition federal tax credit purchase qualified electric vehicle U.S. reduced 3750 Tesla vehicle delivered first second quarter 2019 reduced 1875 Tesla vehicle delivered third fourth quarter 2019 0 Tesla vehicle delivered thereafter . We believe phaseout likely pulled forward vehicle demand 2018 could create similar pullforwards 2019 step reduction federal tax credit . In long run expect meaningful impact sale U.S. believe vehicle model offer compelling proposition even without incentive . Globally also working case already begun increase value proposition affordability offering customer offer financing arrangement time . For example intend introduce leasing option Model 3 . Our Model 3 production ramped dramatically 2018 expect continue grow Model 3 production sustained rate 7000 vehicle per week Tesla Factory end 2019 ramp international delivery . We remain focused cost improvement increasing affordability Model 3 . Furthermore January 2019 commenced construction Gigafactory Shanghai China . We expect build production process optimized simplified Model 3 production comprised stamping body joining paint shop general assembly Gigafactory Shanghai begin production certain trim Model 3 China end 2019 . We believe efficiency local production well avoiding certain tariff U.S.manufactured vehicle allow u offer Model 3 lower average selling price largest market electric vehicle world . Inclusive Gigafactory Shanghai goal able produce 10000 Model 3 vehicle per week sustained basis annualized output rate excess 500000 Model 3 vehicle sometime fourth quarter 2019 second quarter 2020 . However timeframe Gigafactory Shanghai subject number uncertainty including regulatory approval supply chain constraint pace installing production equipment bringing factory online . Ultimately achieving increased Model 3 production costeffectively require timely address additional bottleneck may arise continue ramp establish sustained supplier capacity including locally Gigafactory Shanghai . We also recently discontinued new custom order 75 kWh version Model S Model X focus longer range version highestperformance flagship vehicle differentiate Model 3 . We gradually increased level option standardization across model latest step increasing production efficiency allowed u reduce production hour preserving flexibility increase output necessary . As Model S Model X produced U.S. foreseeable future could impacted increased import duty component sourced China well tariff vehicle exported China although intend partially divert delivery North America Europe necessary . 43 Advancing customerfacing infrastructure remains top priority . Delivering vehicle customer related logistics challenging 2018 continue improve process maximize customer satisfaction including purchasing carhauling truck . We also expanding servicing capability rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet including growing service location Mobile Service fleet moving twoshift operation service center needed optimizing part distribution network .
