Automobile Manufacturer Dealer Regulation State law regulates manufacture distribution sale automobile generally requires motor vehicle manufacturer dealer licensed . We registered motor vehicle manufacturer dealer state California Colorado Florida Illinois Washington licensed motor vehicle dealer state New York . We similarly licensed District Columbia EV retail store . To extent possible plan secure dealer license equivalent dealer license engage activity motor vehicle dealer state appropriate necessary open additional Tesla store . Some state Texas permit automobile manufacturer licensed dealer act capacity dealer . To sell vehicle resident state licensed dealer extent permitted local law actual sale activity related sale would generally occur state . In scenario possible activity related marketing advertising taking order taking reservation reservation payment delivering vehicle could viewed state conducting unlicensed activity state otherwise violating state motor vehicle industry law . Regulators state may require u hold meet requirement appropriate dealer license state manufacturer prohibited acting dealer may otherwise prohibit impact planned activity . In jurisdiction Tesla store customer may try purchase vehicle internet . However state Kansas law providing manufacturer deliver vehicle resident state except dealer licensed business state may interpreted require u open store state Kansas order sell vehicle Kansas resident . Such law may interpreted require u open store state sell vehicle resident state . In state opened viewing gallery full retail location possible state regulator could take position activity gallery constitute unlicensed motor vehicle dealership thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer law . For example state Colorado required u obtain dealer manufacturer license state order operate gallery Colorado . Although would prefer state regulator address concern nature discussing concern u requesting voluntary compliance state could also take action u including levying fine requiring refrain certain activity location . In addition state requirement service facility available respect vehicle sold state may interpreted also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet resident state thereby limiting ability sell vehicle state maintain service facility . 26 Table Contents The foregoing example state law governing sale motor vehicle regulation face sell vehicle . In many state application state motor vehicle law specific sale model largely without precedent particularly respect sale internet would determined fact specific analysis numerous factor including whether physical presence employee applicable state whether advertise conduct activity applicable state sale transaction structured volume sale state whether state question prohibits manufacturer acting dealer . As result fact specific untested nature issue fact applying law intended traditional automobile distribution model sale model allows interpretation discretion regulator state legal prohibition may prevent u selling consumer state . California law potentially law state restrict ability licensed dealer advertise take deposit vehicle available . In November 2007 became aware New Motor Vehicle Board California Department Transportation considered whether reservation advertising policy comply law . To date received communication topic New Motor Vehicle Board Department Motor Vehicles DMV power enforce law . There assurance DMV take position vehicle reservation advertising practice violate law . We expect DMV determines may violated law would initially discus concern u request voluntary compliance . If ultimately found violation California law might precluded taking reservation payment DMV could take action u including levying fine requiring u refund reservation payment . Resolution inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspect reservation program . The DMV also power suspend license manufacture sell vehicle California following hearing merit typically exercised case significant repeat violation andor refusal comply DMV direction . Certain state may specific law apply dealer manufacturer selling directly consumer . For example state Washington requires reservation payment payment received resident state Washington must placed segregated account delivery vehicle account must unencumbered lien creditor dealer may used dealer . Consequently established segregated account reservation payment state Washington January 2010 . There assurance state foreign jurisdiction require similar segregation reservation payment received customer . Our inability access fund working capital purpose could harm liquidity . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . In addition licensing law specific law regulation state interpretation regulator may limit determine sell market advertise otherwise solicit sale take order take reservation reservation payment deliver service vehicle consumer engage activity state . While performed analysis law certain jurisdiction Tesla store performed complete analysis jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . 27 Table Contents Competition Competition automotive industry intense evolving .

Our distribution model different predominant current distribution model automobile manufacturer make evaluating business operating result future prospect difficult . Our distribution model common automobile industry today particularly United States . We plan continue sell performance electric vehicle internet companyowned Tesla store . This model vehicle distribution relatively new unproven especially United States subject u substantial risk requires aggregate significant expenditure provides slower expansion distribution sale system may possible utilizing traditional dealer franchise system . For example able utilize long established sale channel developed franchise system increase sale volume may harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Moreover competing company wellestablished distribution channel . As December 31 2010 opened 16 Tesla store United States Europe Japan seven open le one year . We limited experience distributing selling performance vehicle Tesla store . As December 31 2010 sold approximately 1500 Tesla Roadsters customer primarily United States Europe . Our success depend large part ability effectively develop sale channel marketing strategy . Implementing business model subject numerous significant challenge including obtaining permit approval local state authority may successful addressing challenge . We plan introduce new store concept 2011 enhance customer purchasing experience generate greater visibility Tesla product area high customer foot traffic . We know whether store strategy meet anticipated objective may incur additional cost order improve change strategy . You must consider business prospect light risk uncertainty difficulty encounter implement business model . For instance need persuade customer supplier regulator validity sustainability business model . We certain able successfully address risk uncertainty difficulty business strategy face . Any failure successfully address risk uncertainty difficulty related business model would material adverse effect business prospect . We may face regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle directly internet could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . We sell vehicle Tesla store well internet . We may able sell vehicle sale model state United States many state law may interpreted prohibit internet sale manufacturer resident state impose limitation sale model including law prohibit manufacturer selling vehicle directly consumer without use independent dealership without physical presence state . For example state Texas prohibits manufacturer licensed dealer act capacity dealer would prohibit u operating store state Texas may restrict ability sell vehicle Texas 39 Table Contents resident internet state altogether without altering sale model . The state Kansas provides manufacturer deliver vehicle Kansas resident except dealer licensed business state Kansas may interpreted require u open store state Kansas order sell vehicle Kansas resident . In state opened gallery location potential customer view vehicle full retail location possible state regulator could take position activity gallery constitute unlicensed motor vehicle dealership thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer law . For example state Colorado required u obtain dealer manufacturer license state order operate gallery Colorado . In addition state requirement service facility available respect vehicle sold state may interpreted also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet resident state thereby limiting ability sell vehicle state maintain service facility . The foregoing example state law governing sale motor vehicle regulation face sell vehicle . In many state application state motor vehicle law specific sale model largely untested state motor vehicle industry law particularly respect sale internet would determined fact specific analysis numerous factor including whether physical presence employee applicable state whether advertise conduct activity applicable state sale transaction structured volume sale state whether state question prohibits manufacturer acting dealer . As result fact specific untested nature issue fact applying law intended traditional automobile distribution model sale model allows interpretation discretion regulator manner applicable authority apply state law distribution model unknown . Such law well law governing motor vehicle industry may subject u potential inquiry investigation state motor vehicle regulator may question whether sale model complies applicable state motor vehicle industry law may require u change sale model may prohibit ability sell vehicle resident state . In addition decision regulator permitting u sell vehicle may subject challenge whether decision comply applicable state motor vehicle industry law . Such challenge successful could prohibit ability sell vehicle resident state . To date registered motor vehicle manufacturer dealer California Colorado Florida Illinois Washington licensed motor vehicle dealer state New York . We yet sought formal clarification ability sell vehicle state . We also registered motor vehicle manufacturer dealer Canada Australia Japan obtained license sell vehicle country Hong Kong Singapore . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . Regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . A large amount Tesla Roadster sale revenue due fulfillment order reservation taken prior year . As December 31 2010 sold approximately 1500 Tesla Roadsters customer large number delivered 2009 made significant effort fulfill reservation placed prior year . Since 2009 experienced future expect significant wait list order Tesla Roadster may able maintain increase vehicle sale revenue future quarter . This 40 Table Contents may case even though make significant investment expand network Tesla store sale personnel . Furthermore potential customer may decide defer purchasing Tesla Roadster anticipation planned next generation Tesla Roadster Model S. All reservation payment Model S fully refundable . Reservations Model S sedan fully refundable customer . As December 31 2010 unfilled reservation approximately 3400 Model S sedan subject cancellation customer time customer enters purchase agreement . Historically reservation refundable significant number customer submitted reservation Tesla Roadster cancel reservation refunded deposit . Given long lead time historically experienced customer reservation delivery Tesla Roadster expect experience Model S heightened risk customer made reservation may ultimately take delivery vehicle due potential change customer preference competitive development factor . For example delayed introduction original Tesla Roadster fall 2007 experienced significant number customer cancelled reservation requested return reservation payment . If encounter delay introduction Model S believe significant number customer could similarly cancel reservation . As result assurance made reservation cancelled ultimately result final purchase delivery sale vehicle . Such cancellation could harm financial condition business prospect operating result .

If unable establish maintain confidence business prospect among consumer within industry financial condition operating result business prospect may suffer materially . 44 Table Contents Our vehicle highly technical product require maintenance support . If cease cut back operation even year buyer vehicle year earlier might much difficulty maintaining vehicle obtaining satisfactory support . As result consumer may le likely purchase vehicle convinced business succeed operation continue many year . Similarly supplier third party le likely invest time resource developing business relationship u convinced business succeed . For example economic downturn 2008 difficulty raising necessary funding operation result fourth quarter 2008 lay approximately 60 employee curtail expansion plan . In addition period number customer canceled previously placed reservation . If required take similar action future action may result negative perception regarding longterm business prospect . Accordingly order build maintain business must maintain confidence among customer supplier party liquidity longterm business prospect . In contrast established auto maker believe case task maintaining confidence may particularly complicated factor following limited operating history limited revenue lack profitability date unfamiliarity uncertainty Tesla Roadster Model S uncertainty longterm marketplace acceptance alternative fuel vehicle generally electric vehicle specifically prospect need ongoing infusion external capital fund planned operation size expansion plan comparison existing capital base scope history operation prospect actual emergence direct sustained competitive pressure established auto maker may likely initial effort perceived commercially successful . Many factor largely outside control negative perception longterm business prospect even exaggerated unfounded would likely harm business make difficult raise additional fund needed . We may need raise additional fund fund may available u need . If raise additional fund need operation prospect could negatively affected . The design manufacture sale servicing automobile capital intensive business . Since inception December 31 2010 incurred net loss approximately 415.0 million used approximately 330.6 million cash operation recognizing approximately 243.5 million revenue . As December 31 2010 99.6 million cash cash equivalent excludes 73.6 million restricted cash set aside principally fund dedicated account provision DOE Loan Facility . We expect current source liquidity including cash cash equivalent cash held DOE account remaining amount available DOE Loan Facility together anticipated cash operating activity sufficient fund operation initial customer delivery Model S. However delay launch Model S unable draw anticipated fund DOE Loan Facility cost building Model S powertrain manufacturing facility exceed expectation incur significant unplanned expense may need raise additional fund issuance equity equityrelated debt security obtaining credit government financial institution . This capital necessary fund ongoing operation continue research development design effort including planned Model X vehicle establish sale service center improve infrastructure expanded battery assembly facility make 45 Table Contents investment tooling manufacturing capital required introduce Model S. We certain additional fund available u favorable term required . If raise additional fund need financial condition result operation business prospect could materially adversely affected . For example economic downturn 2008 difficulty raising necessary funding operation result fourth quarter 2008 lay approximately 60 employee curtail expansion plan . Additionally DOE Loan Facility face restriction ability incur additional indebtedness future may need obtain waiver DOE order . We may able obtain waiver DOE may harm business . Future issuance equity equityrelated security dilute ownership interest existing stockholder issuance debt security could increase risk perceived risk company . If vehicle fail perform expected ability develop market sell electric vehicle could harmed . Our vehicle may contain defect design manufacture may cause perform expected may require repair . For example vehicle use substantial amount software code operate . Software product inherently complex often contain defect error first introduced . While performed extensive internal testing currently limited frame reference evaluate longterm performance Tesla Roadster . We frame reference evaluate Model S upon business prospect depend . There assurance able detect fix defect vehicle prior sale consumer . We experienced product recall May 2009 October 2010 unrelated electric powertrain . In May 2009 initiated product recall determined condition caused insufficient torquing rear inner hub flange bolt existed Tesla Roadsters result missed process manufacture Tesla Roadster glider partially assembled Tesla Roadster contain electric powertrain . In October 2010 initiated product recall 12 volt low voltage auxiliary cable single vehicle chafed edge carbon fiber panel vehicle causing short smoke possible fire behind right front headlamp vehicle . Although cost recent recall material may experience additional recall future could adversely affect brand target market could adversely affect business prospect result operation . Our electric vehicle including Tesla Roadster Model S may perform consistent customer expectation consistent vehicle currently available . For example electric vehicle may durability longevity current vehicle may easy repair vehicle currently market . Any product defect failure performance electric vehicle perform expected could harm reputation result adverse publicity lost revenue delivery delay product recall product liability claim harm brand reputation significant warranty expense could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . We limited experience servicing vehicle using different service model one typically used industry . If unable address service requirement existing future customer business materially adversely affected . If unable successfully address service requirement existing future customer business prospect materially adversely affected . In addition anticipate level quality service provide Tesla Roadster customer direct impact success Model S future vehicle . If unable satisfactorily service Tesla Roadster customer ability generate customer loyalty grow business sell additional Tesla Roadsters well Model S sedan could impaired . We limited experience servicing vehicle . As December 31 2010 sold approximately 1500 Tesla Roadsters customer primarily United States Europe . We plan begin production Model S vehicle mid2012 higher volume production occurring 46 Table Contents 2013 experience servicing car exist currently . Servicing electric vehicle different servicing vehicle internal combustion engine requires specialized skill including high voltage training servicing technique . We plan service performance electric vehicle companyowned Tesla store mobile service technician known Tesla Rangers . As December 31 2010 opened 16 Tesla store equipped actively service performance electric vehicle . However seven store open le one year date limited experience servicing performance vehicle Tesla store . Going forward intend build separate sale service location several market date limited experience separate sale service location within geographic market . We need open additional Tesla store service capability standalone service location well hire train significant number new employee staff center act Tesla Rangers order successfully maintain fleet delivered performance electric vehicle . We implemented Tesla Rangers program October 2009 limited experience deploying service customer vehicle . There assurance service arrangement limited experience servicing vehicle adequately address service requirement customer satisfaction sufficient resource meet service requirement timely manner volume vehicle able deliver annually increase . We expect able open Tesla store geographic area existing potential customer may reside . In order address service need customer geographical proximity service center plan either transport vehicle nearest Tesla store service center servicing deploy mobile Tesla Rangers service vehicle customer location . These special arrangement may expensive may able recoup cost providing service customer . In addition number potential customer may choose purchase vehicle lack widespread service network . If adequately address customer service need brand reputation adversely affected turn could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . Traditional automobile manufacturer provide maintenance repair service directly . Consumers must rather service vehicle franchised dealership third party maintenance service provider . We arrangement third party service provider unclear even whether third party service provider able acquire expertise service vehicle . At point anticipate providing substantially service vehicle foreseeable future . As vehicle placed location may encounter negative reaction consumer frustrated use local service station extent conventional automobile frustration may result negative publicity reduced sale thereby harming business prospect . In addition motor vehicle industry law many state require service facility available respect vehicle physically sold location state . Whether law would also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet consumer state physical presence uncertain . While believe Tesla Ranger program practice shipping customer vehicle nearest Tesla store service would satisfy regulator circumstance without seeking formal regulatory guidance assurance regulator attempt require provide physical service facility state . Further certain state franchise law prohibit manufacturer licensed dealer acting capacity dealer also restrict manufacturer providing vehicle service . If issue arise connection law certain aspect Teslas service program would need restructured comply state law may harm business . 47 Table Contents We may succeed continuing establish maintain strengthen Tesla brand would materially adversely affect customer acceptance vehicle component business revenue prospect . Our business prospect heavily dependent ability develop maintain strengthen Tesla brand . Any failure develop maintain strengthen brand may materially adversely affect ability sell Tesla Roadster planned electric vehicle including Model S sell electric powertrain component . If continue establish maintain strengthen brand may lose opportunity build critical mass customer .

If develop maintain strong brand business prospect financial condition operating result materially adversely impacted . We dependent upon relationship Lotus manufacturing Tesla Roadster . In July 2005 entered supply agreement Lotus amended March 2010 pursuant Lotus agreed assist design manufacture Tesla Roadster . Although complete final assembly Tesla Roadster Menlo Park facility vehicle destined United States market currently dependent upon Lotus complete initial portion assembly process Tesla Roadster u Hethel England expect continue discontinue sale current generation Tesla Roadster . The partially assembled vehicle manufactured Lotus contain electric powertrain referred glider . We currently intend manufacture glider Lotus current generation Tesla Roadster January 2012 . We intend use glider manufacturing Tesla Roadster fulfill order placed 2011 well new order placed 2012 supply glider exhausted . Accordingly intend offer limited number Tesla Roadsters sale 2012 . We anticipate next generation Tesla Roadster plan launch least one year begin production Model S manufactured facility . Pursuant supply agreement Lotus obligated purchase minimum 2400 partially assembled fully assembled vehicle term agreement . If unable meet volume requirement still responsible payment Lotus lesser sum Lotus actual incurred cost agreed upon profit margin per vehicle minimum volume requirement ii 5400000 . To extent would like produce number vehicle contracted need negotiate new amended supply agreement Lotus may unable term condition favorable u . In event may required contract another third party replace Lotus would entail redesign Tesla Roadster chassis adjustment supply chain establishment light manufacturing facility . The expense time required complete transition assure vehicle glider manufactured facility comply relevant regulatory requirement may turn higher anticipated . Entry contract another third party might also require u agree term Lotus Lotus would license certain intellectual property right necessary manufacture Tesla Roadster third party . There assurance able find third party complete partial manufacture Tesla Roadster term favorable u . In addition assurance able enter intellectual property right 48 Table Contents license Lotus term favorable u . Additionally dependent upon relationship Lotus manufacturing Tesla Roadster business depends Lotus continuing operate viable solvent entity continue produce Tesla Roadster vehicle glider pursuant supply agreement . Any delay discontinuance Lotus delivery Tesla Roadster vehicle glider failure Lotus produce vehicle glider accordance quality standard would material adverse effect business prospect operating result financial condition . We dependent supplier significant number single limited source supplier inability supplier continue deliver refusal deliver necessary component vehicle price volume acceptable u would material adverse effect business prospect operating result . The Tesla Roadster us 2000 purchased part source globally 150 supplier many currently single source supplier component . While obtain component multiple source whenever possible similar automobile manufacturer many component used vehicle purchased u single source . We refer component supplier single source supplier . To date qualified alternative source single sourced component used vehicle generally maintain longterm agreement single source supplier . While believe may able establish alternate supply relationship obtain engineer replacement component single source component may unable short term price cost favorable u . In particular believe able secure alternate source supply almost single sourced component relatively short time frame qualifying alternate supplier developing replacement certain highly customized component Tesla Roadster carbon fiber body panel supplied u Sotira 35 unit Sora Composites Group may time consuming costly . In addition Lotus manufacturer certain component chassis Tesla Roadster . We therefore refer sole source supplier . Replacing component Lotus sole sourced may require u reengineer vehicle would time consuming costly . We currently utilize sole source supplier Lotus . This supply chain expose u multiple potential source delivery failure component shortage Tesla Roadster powertrain component sale activity planned Model S. We currently evaluating qualifying selecting supplier planned production Model S intend establish dual supplier several key component Model S although expect number component Model S single sourced . We past experienced source disruption supply chain caused delay production process may experience additional delay future . Changes business condition war governmental change factor beyond control presently anticipate could also affect supplier ability deliver component u timely basis . Furthermore experience significant increased demand need replace existing supplier assurance additional supply component part available required term favorable u supplier would allocate sufficient supply u order meet requirement fill order timely manner . In past replaced certain supplier failure provide component met quality control standard . The loss single limited source supplier disruption supply component supplier could lead delay vehicle delivery customer could hurt relationship customer also materially adversely affect business prospect operating result . Changes supply chain resulted past may result future increased cost delay . For example change supplier carbon fiber body panel contributed delay 49 Table Contents ability ramp production Tesla Roadster . A failure supplier provide component necessary manufacture performance electric vehicle could prevent u fulfilling customer order timely fashion could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition since fixed pricing arrangement component supplier Lotus component supplier could increase price little notice u could harm financial condition operating result unable pas price increase along customer . Increases cost disruption supply shortage raw material particular lithiumion cell could harm business . We may experience increase cost sustained interruption supply shortage raw material . Any increase supply interruption could materially negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We use various raw material business including aluminum steel nickel carbon fiber nonferrous metal copper well cobalt . The price raw material fluctuate depending market condition global demand material could adversely affect business operating result . For instance exposed multiple risk relating price fluctuation lithiumion cell . These risk include inability unwillingness current battery manufacturer build operate battery cell manufacturing plant supply number lithiumion cell required support growth electric plugin hybrid vehicle industry demand cell increase disruption supply cell due quality issue recall battery cell manufacturer increase cost raw material cobalt used lithiumion cell . Our business dependent continued supply battery cell vehicle battery pack produce automobile manufacturer . While believe several source battery cell selected Tesla Roadster available fully qualified one supplier cell used Tesla Roadster . The also true battery cell used battery pack supply OEMs . Any disruption supply battery cell vendor could temporarily disrupt production Tesla Roadster battery pack produce automobile manufacturer time different supplier fully qualified . Moreover battery cell manufacturer may choose refuse supply electric vehicle manufacturer extent determine vehicle sufficiently safe . Furthermore current fluctuation shortage petroleum economic condition may cause u experience significant increase freight charge raw material cost . Substantial increase price raw material would increase operating cost could reduce margin recoup increased cost increased electric vehicle price . There assurance able recoup increasing cost raw material increasing vehicle price . We also already announced estimated price base model planned Model S anticipate announcing final pricing variant Model S least 2011 . However attempt increase announced expected price response increased raw material cost could viewed negatively customer result cancellation Model S reservation could materially adversely affect brand image business prospect operating result . We currently expanding improving information technology system . If implementation successful business operation could disrupted operating result could harmed . We currently expanding improving information technology system assist u management business . In particular production Model S necessitate improvement design development expanded supply chain system support operation well production shop floor management . The implementation new software management platform addition platform new location require significant management time support cost . Moreover 50 Table Contents inherent risk associated developing improving expanding core system including supply chain disruption may affect ability obtain supply needed deliver vehicle Tesla store customer . We sure expanded system fully effectively implemented timely basis . If successfully implement project operation may disrupted operating result could harmed . In addition new system may operate expect may required expend significant resource correct problem find alternative source performing function . If vehicle owner customize vehicle change charging infrastructure aftermarket product vehicle may operate properly could harm business . Automobile enthusiast may seek hack vehicle modify performance could compromise vehicle safety system . Also aware customer customized vehicle aftermarket part may compromise driver safety . For example customer installed seat elevate driver airbag safety system could compromised . Other customer changed wheel tire others installed large speaker system may impact electrical system vehicle . We tested endorse change product . In addition customer use improper external cabling unsafe charging outlet expose customer injury high voltage electricity . Such unauthorized modification could reduce safety vehicle injury resulting modification could result adverse publicity would negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . The success business depends attracting retaining large number customer . If unable able achieve profitability . Our success depends attracting large number potential customer purchase electric vehicle . As December 31 2010 sold approximately 1500 Tesla Roadsters customer almost sold United States Europe accepted reservation approximately 3400 Model S sedan . If existing prospective customer perceive vehicle service sufficiently high value quality cost competitive appealing aesthetic performance final production version Model S sufficiently similar drivable design prototype may able retain current customer attract new customer business prospect operating result financial condition would suffer result . In addition performance electric vehicle date sold largely word mouth marketing effort may required incur significantly higher sustained advertising promotional expenditure previously incurred attract customer use traditional advertising technique . In addition engage traditional advertising may face review consumer protection enforcement agency may incur significant expense ensure advertising claim fully supported . To date limited experience selling electric vehicle may successful attracting retaining large number customer . For example significant number store open le one year portion sale team come background automotive . If reason able attract maintain customer business prospect operating result financial condition would materially harmed . Regulators could review practice taking reservation payment practice deemed violate applicable law could required pay penalty refund reservation payment received vehicle immediately available delivery stop accepting additional reservation payment restructure certain aspect reservation program potentially suspend revoke license manufacture sell vehicle . We yet commenced production Model S sedan currently plan mid2012 . For customer interested reserving Model S require initial refundable reservation payment least 5000 . As December 31 2010 collected reservation payment Model S sedan aggregate 51 Table Contents amount 28.3 million . At time plan hold reservation payment separately escrow trust fund pay interest reservation payment except extent applicable state law require u . We generally use fund working capital general corporate purpose . California law potentially law state restrict ability licensed auto dealer advertise take deposit vehicle vehicle available dealer manufacturer . In November 2007 became aware New Motor Vehicle Board California Department Transportation considered whether reservation policy advertising comply California Vehicle Code . To date received communication topic New Motor Vehicle Board Department Motor Vehicles DMV power enforce law . There assurance DMV take position vehicle reservation advertising practice violate law . We expect DMV determines may violated law would initially discus concern u request voluntary compliance . If ultimately found violation California law might precluded taking reservation payment DMV could take action u including levying fine requiring u refund reservation payment . Resolution inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspect reservation program . In addition California currently jurisdiction license manufacture sell vehicle limitation imposed operation California may particularly damaging business . The DMV also power suspend license manufacture sell vehicle California following hearing merit typically exercised case significant repeat violation andor refusal comply DMV direction . Certain state may specific law apply reservation payment accepted dealer manufacturer selling directly consumer . For example state Washington requires reservation payment payment received resident state Washington must placed segregated account delivery vehicle account must unencumbered lien creditor dealer may used dealer . Consequently established segregated account reservation payment state Washington January 2010 . There assurance state foreign jurisdiction require similar segregation reservation payment received customer . Our inability access fund working capital purpose could harm liquidity . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . If vehicle reservation advertising practice business practice found violate law jurisdiction may face exposure law business prospect would adversely affected . For example required return reservation payment amount may need raise additional fund make payment . There assurance funding would available timely basis commercially reasonable term . If court find reservation agreement advertising comply state law may face exposure law may include exposure consumer protection statute deal unfair competition false advertising . Moreover reduction cash result redemption inability take reservation payment could also make difficult u obtain additional financing . The prospect reduction cash even unrealized may also make difficult obtain financing . Our plan expand network Tesla store require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale electric vehicle . In addition may able open store certain state . Our plan expand network Tesla store require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale electric vehicle . This planned global expansion Tesla store may desired effect increasing sale expanding 52 Table Contents brand presence degree anticipating . Furthermore assurance able construct additional storefront budget timeline established . We also need ensure compliance regulatory requirement applicable sale vehicle jurisdiction could take considerable time expense . If experience delay expanding network Tesla store could lead decrease sale vehicle could negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . As December 31 2010 opened 16 Tesla store major metropolitan area throughout United States Europe Japan . We plan open additional store 2011 goal establishing approximately 50 store globally within next several year connection planned Model S rollout . However may able expand network rate planned expansion network Tesla store require significant cash investment management resource well efficiency execution establishing storefront hiring training necessary employee effectively sell vehicle . Furthermore certain state foreign jurisdiction may permit requirement franchise dealer law similar law regulation may preclude restrict ability open store sell vehicle state jurisdiction . Any prohibition restriction may lead decreased sale jurisdiction could harm business prospect operating result . We recently began offer leasing alternative customer expose u risk commonly associated prolonged ownership vehicle extension consumer credit . We began offering leasing alternative customer Tesla Roadster United States market February 2010 wholly owned subsidiary Tesla Motors Leasing Inc. During latter half 2010 began offering leasing alternative Canada Canadian subsidiary . Under program currently permit qualifying customer lease Tesla Roadster 36 month time option either returning vehicle u purchasing predetermined residual value . We retain responsibility timely collection payment customer therefore exposed possibility loss customer failure make payment according contract term . As retain ownership vehicle customer option returning vehicle u lease complete also exposed risk vehicle residual value may lower estimate volume vehicle returned u may higher estimate . Currently limited secondary market electric vehicle particular electric vehicle general base estimate secondary market may develop future . Our credit loss could exceed expectation residual value return volume estimate could prove adversely incorrect either could harm financial condition operating result . We face risk associated international operation including unfavorable regulatory political tax labor condition could harm business . We face risk associated international operation including possible unfavorable regulatory political tax labor condition could harm business . We currently international operation subsidiary Australia Canada Denmark France Germany Hong Kong Italy Japan Monaco Singapore Switzerland Taiwan United Kingdom subject legal political regulatory social requirement economic condition jurisdiction . Additionally part growth strategy intend expand sale maintenance repair service internationally . However limited experience date selling servicing vehicle internationally expansion would require u make significant expenditure including hiring local employee establishing facility advance generating revenue . We subject number risk associated international business activity may increase cost impact ability sell electric vehicle require significant management attention . These risk include conforming vehicle various international regulatory requirement vehicle sold homologation 53 Table Contents difficulty staffing managing foreign operation difficulty attracting customer new jurisdiction foreign government tax regulation permit requirement including foreign tax may able offset tax imposed upon u United States foreign tax law limiting ability repatriate fund United States fluctuation foreign currency exchange rate interest rate including risk related interest rate swap hedging activity undertake ability enforce contractual intellectual property right especially foreign country respect protect intellectual property right extent United States Japan European country increase risk unauthorized uncompensated use technology United States foreign government trade restriction tariff price exchange control foreign labor law regulation restriction preference foreign nation domestically produced vehicle change diplomatic trade relationship political instability natural disaster war event terrorism strength international economy . We also face risk cost denominated foreign currency increase foreign currency strengthen quickly significantly dollar . A portion cost expense year ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 denominated foreign currency British pound euro . This primarily due contract Lotus United Kingdom assemble Tesla Roadster vehicle glider part sourced Europe . In addition international sale marketing operation incur expense denominated foreign currency principally British pound euro Japanese yen . If value United States dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured United States dollar correspondingly increase operating result adversely affected . In addition battery cell purchase Asian supplier subject currency risk . Although present contract United States dollar based United States dollar depreciates significantly local currency could cause Asian supplier significantly raise price could harm financial result . If fail successfully address risk business prospect operating result financial condition could materially harmed . The unavailability reduction elimination government economic incentive could material adverse effect business financial condition operating result prospect . Any reduction elimination discriminatory application government subsidy economic incentive policy change reduced need subsidy incentive due perceived success electric vehicle fiscal tightening reason may result diminished competitiveness alternative fuel vehicle industry generally electric vehicle particular . This could materially adversely affect growth alternative fuel automobile market business prospect financial condition operating result . Our growth depends part availability amount government subsidy economic incentive alternative fuel vehicle generally performance electric vehicle specifically . For example December 2009 finalized arrangement California Alternative Energy Advanced 54 Table Contents Transportation Financing Authority result exemption California state sale use tax 320 million manufacturing equipment . To extent equipment purchased would otherwise subject California state sale use tax believe incentive would result tax saving u approximately 31 million three year period starting December 2009 . This exemption available equipment would otherwise subject California sale use tax would used following three purpose establish production facility Model S sedan upgrade Palo Alto powertrain production facility expand current Tesla Roadster assembly operation Menlo Park facility . If fail meet condition would unable take full advantage tax incentive financial position could harmed . In addition certain regulation encourage sale electric car could reduced eliminated applied way creates adverse effect vehicle either currently time future . For example federal state government time time enacted tax credit incentive purchase alternative fuel car competitor experience greater resource working legislator guarantee vehicle would eligible tax credit incentive provided alternative fuel vehicle future . This would put vehicle competitive disadvantage . As another example government disincentive enacted Europe gaspowered vehicle discourage use vehicle allow u set higher sale price Tesla Roadster Europe . In event disincentive reduced eliminated sale electric vehicle including Tesla Roadster could adversely affected . Furthermore low volume manufacturer exempt certain regulatory requirement United States European Union . This provides u advantage high volume manufacturer must comply regulation . Once reach certain threshold number sale United States European Union longer able take advantage exemption respective jurisdiction could lead u incur additional design manufacturing expense . We anticipate able take advantage exemption respect Model S plan produce significantly higher volume Tesla Roadster . If unable grow sale electric vehicle component original equipment manufacturer financial result may suffer . In addition Daimler proceeds plan produce lithiumion battery 2012 part joint venture Evonik Industries AG likely lose significant customer powertrain business . We may trouble attracting retaining powertrain customer could adversely affect business prospect result . Daimler affiliate Toyota currently customer electric powertrain sale development service . In May 2009 formalized development agreement Daimler result performed specified research development service . In addition selected Daimler supply 1800 battery pack charger support trial Smart fortwo electric drive least five European city .

In addition negotiating agreement Daimler provide u access various part automotive support engineering Model S regarding various area strategic cooperation Daimler although assurance able enter agreement . However relationship Daimler pose various risk u including potential delay launching Model S lose Daimlers automotive support unable find alternative timely manner potential loss access various part incorporating Model S design potential loss business adverse publicity brand image defect problem discovered electric powertrain component Daimler incorporated vehicle . The occurrence foregoing could adversely affect business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition exclusivity intellectual property agreement EIP Agreement Daimler North America Corporation DNAC affiliate Daimler provides Daimler competitor offer enter competitive strategic transaction u required give DNAC notice offer DNAC specified period time notify u whether wish enter transaction u term offered third party . Because able enter transaction third party DNAC decline may decrease likelihood receive offer third party enter strategic arrangement future . Our relationship Toyota subject various risk could adversely affect business future prospect . In October 2010 Toyota entered agreement develop validated electric powertrain Toyota RAV4 . We also previously announced intention Tesla receive Toyotas support sourcing part production engineering expertise Model S. However entered agreement Toyota assistance commercial supply may never . There assurance able enter agreement Toyota longterm supply electric powertrains Toyota RAV4 vehicle . We may able identify adequate strategic relationship opportunity form strategic relationship future . Strategic business relationship important factor growth success business . For example strategic relationship Daimler provided u various benefit recently entered agreement develop validated electric powertrain Toyota RAV4 Toyota . However assurance able identify secure suitable business relationship opportunity future competitor may capitalize opportunity . Our strategic relationship Daimler involved Blackstar affiliate Daimler making significant equity investment u well representative Daimler Dr. Herbert Kohler joining Board . In addition Toyota made significant equity investment u concurrent closing IPO July 2010 . We may able 56 Table Contents offer similar benefit company would like establish maintain strategic relationship could impair ability establish relationship . Moreover identifying opportunity could demand substantial management time resource negotiating financing relationship involves significant cost uncertainty . If unable successfully source execute strategic relationship opportunity future overall growth could impaired business prospect operating result could materially adversely affected . If fail manage future growth effectively may able market sell vehicle successfully . Any failure manage growth effectively could materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . We recently expanded operation significantly increasing total number employee 268 December 31 2007 899 December 31 2010 significant expansion required especially connection planned establishment Model S manufacturing facility electric powertrain manufacturing facility expansion network Tesla store service center mobile Tesla Rangers program requirement public company . Our future operating result depend large extent ability manage expansion growth successfully . Risks face undertaking expansion include training new personnel forecasting production revenue controlling expense investment anticipation expanded operation establishing expanding design manufacturing sale service facility implementing enhancing administrative infrastructure system process addressing new market expanding international operation . We intend continue hire significant number additional personnel including design manufacturing personnel service technician performance electric vehicle . Because highperformance vehicle based different technology platform traditional internal combustion engine individual sufficient training performance electric vehicle may available hire need expend significant time expense training employee hire . Competition individual experience designing manufacturing servicing electric vehicle intense may able attract assimilate train retain additional highly qualified personnel future . The failure attract integrate train motivate retain additional employee could seriously harm business prospect .
