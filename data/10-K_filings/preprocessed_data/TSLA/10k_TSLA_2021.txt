RISK FACTORS You carefully consider risk described together information set forth report could materially affect business financial condition future result . The risk described risk facing company . Risks uncertainty currently known u currently deem immaterial also may materially adversely affect business financial condition operating result . Risks Related Our Ability Grow Our Business We may impacted macroeconomic condition resulting global COVID19 pandemic . Since first quarter 2020 worldwide impact COVID19 pandemic . Government regulation shifting social behavior limited closed nonessential transportation government function business activity persontoperson interaction . In case relaxation trend followed actual contemplated return stringent restriction gathering commerce including part U.S. rest world . During 2020 temporarily suspended operation manufacturing facility worldwide certain supplier also shut operation temporarily permanently including recently reimposed lockdown certain part world . We instituted temporary employee furlough compensation reduction U.S. operation scaled back . Temporary impediment administrative activity supporting operation also hampered product delivery deployment . Global trade condition consumer trend originated pandemic continue persist may also longlasting adverse impact u industry independently progress pandemic . For example pandemicrelated issue exacerbated port congestion intermittent supplier shutdown delay resulting additional expense expedite delivery critical part . Similarly increased demand personal electronics created shortfall semiconductor caused challenge supply chain production . In addition labor shortage resulting pandemic including worker absenteeism may lead increased difficulty hiring retaining manufacturing service worker well increased labor cost . Sustaining production trajectory require ongoing readiness solvency supplier vendor stable motivated production workforce government cooperation including travel visa allowance . The contingency inherent construction ramp new facility Gigafactory Berlin Gigafactory Texas may exacerbated challenge . We predict duration direction current global trend sustained impact . Ultimately continue monitor macroeconomic condition remain flexible optimize evolve business appropriate accurately project demand infrastructure requirement globally deploy production workforce resource accordingly . If experience unfavorable global market condition maintain operation scope commensurate condition later required choose suspend operation business prospect financial condition operating result may harmed . We may experience delay launching ramping production product feature may unable control manufacturing cost . We previously experienced may future experience launch production ramp delay new product feature . For example encountered unanticipated supplier issue led delay initial ramp first Model X experienced challenge supplier ramping full automation certain initial Model 3 manufacturing process . In addition may introduce future new unique manufacturing process design feature product . There guarantee able successfully timely introduce scale process feature . In particular future business depends large part increasing production massmarket vehicle including Model 3 Model Y planning achieve multiple factory worldwide . We relatively limited experience date manufacturing Model 3 Model Y high volume even le experience building ramping vehicle production line across multiple factory different geography . In order successful need implement maintain ramp efficient costeffective manufacturing capability process supply chain achieve design tolerance high quality output rate planned manufacturing facility California Nevada Texas China Germany . We also need hire train compensate skilled employee operate facility . Bottlenecks unexpected challenge experienced past may arise production ramp must address promptly continuing improve manufacturing process reducing cost . If successful achieving goal could face delay establishing andor sustaining Model 3 Model Y ramp unable meet related cost profitability target . We may also experience similar future delay launching andor ramping production energy storage product Solar Roof new product version variant recently updated Model S Model X new vehicle Tesla Semi Cybertruck new Tesla Roadster future feature service based artificial intelligence new Autopilot FSD 14 functionality autonomous Tesla ridehailing network robotics . Likewise may encounter delay design construction regulatory approval necessary build bring online future manufacturing facility product . Any delay complication ramping production current product development manufacture launch production ramp future product feature service costeffectively high quality may harm brand business prospect financial condition operating result . We may unable grow global product sale delivery installation capability servicing vehicle charging network may unable accurately project effectively manage growth . Our success depend ability continue expand sale capability . We targeting Model 3 Model Y global mass demographic broad range potential customer relatively limited experience projecting demand pricing product . We currently produce numerous international variant limited number factory specific demand expectation variant prove inaccurate may able timely generate delivery matched vehicle produce timeframe commensurate size operation given region . Likewise develop grow energy product service worldwide success depend ability correctly forecast demand various market . Because independent dealer network responsible delivering vehicle customer . We may face difficulty delivery increasing volume particularly international market requiring significant transit time . For example saw challenge ramping logistics channel China Europe initially deliver Model 3 first quarter 2019 . We deployed number delivery model delivery customer home workplace touchless delivery guarantee model scalable accepted globally . Likewise ramp energy product working substantially increase production installation capability . If experience production delay inaccurately forecast demand business financial condition operating result may harmed . Moreover unique expertise vehicle recommend vehicle serviced u certain authorized professional . If experience delay adding servicing capacity servicing vehicle efficiently experience unforeseen issue reliability vehicle particularly highervolume relatively newer addition fleet Model 3 Model Y could overburden servicing capability part inventory . Similarly increasing number Tesla vehicle also requires u continue rapidly increase number Supercharger station connector throughout world . There assurance able ramp business meet sale delivery installation servicing vehicle charging target globally projection target based prove accurate pace growth coverage customer infrastructure network meet customer expectation . These plan require significant cash investment management resource guarantee generate additional sale installation product able avoid cost overrun able hire additional personnel support . As expand also need ensure compliance regulatory requirement various jurisdiction applicable sale installation servicing product sale dispatch electricity related energy product operation Superchargers . If fail manage growth effectively may harm brand business prospect financial condition operating result . Our future growth success dependent upon consumer demand electric vehicle specifically vehicle automotive industry generally competitive cyclical volatile . If market electric vehicle general Tesla vehicle particular develop expect develops slowly expect demand vehicle decrease market vehicle compete business prospect financial condition operating result may harmed . We still earlier stage development limited resource production relative established competitor offer internal combustion engine vehicle . In addition electric vehicle still comprise small percentage overall vehicle sale . As result market vehicle could negatively affected numerous factor perception electric vehicle feature quality safety performance cost perception limited range electric vehicle may driven single battery charge access charging facility competition including type alternative fuel vehicle plugin hybrid electric vehicle high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility cost oil gasoline wide fluctuation crude oil price 2020 government regulation economic incentive concern future viability . 15 Finally target demographic vehicle particularly Model 3 Model Y highly competitive . Sales vehicle automotive industry tend cyclical many market may expose u volatility . Our supplier may fail deliver component according schedule price quality volume acceptable u may unable manage component effectively . Our product contain thousand part purchased globally hundred supplier including singlesource direct supplier expose u multiple potential source component shortage . Unexpected change business condition material pricing labor issue war trade policy natural disaster March 2011 earthquake Japan health epidemic global COVID19 pandemic trade shipping disruption port congestion factor beyond supplier control could also affect supplier ability deliver component u remain solvent operational . For example global shortage semiconductor reported since early 2021 caused challenge manufacturing industry impacted supply chain production well . We used alternative part programmed software mitigate challenge caused shortage guarantee may able continually scale production meet growth target . Additionally supplier accurately forecast effectively allocate production willing allocate sufficient production u may reduce access component require u search new supplier . The unavailability component supplier could result production delay idle manufacturing facility product design change loss access important technology tool producing supporting product well impact capacity expansion ability fulfill obligation customer contract . Moreover significant increase production Model 3 Model Y product design change u required may future require u procure additional component short amount time . Our supplier may willing able sustainably meet timeline cost quality volume need may cost u may require u replace source . Finally limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside Fremont Factory may experience issue increasing level localized procurement Gigafactory Shanghai future factory Gigafactory Berlin Gigafactory Texas . While believe able secure additional alternate source develop replacement component assurance able quickly . Additionally may unsuccessful continuous effort negotiate existing supplier obtain cost reduction avoid unfavorable change term source le expensive supplier certain part redesign certain part make le expensive produce especially light increase material pricing . Any occurrence may harm business prospect financial condition operating result . As scale vehicle production increase also need accurately forecast purchase warehouse transport component high volume manufacturing facility servicing location internationally . If unable accurately match timing quantity component purchase actual need successfully implement automation inventory management system accommodate increased complexity supply chain part management may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation writeoff cost may harm business operating result . We may unable meet projected construction timeline cost production ramp new factory may experience difficulty generating maintaining demand product manufactured . Our ability increase production vehicle sustained basis make affordable globally accessing local supply chain workforce streamline delivery logistics dependent construction ramp current future factory . The construction commencement ramp production factory subject number uncertainty inherent new manufacturing operation including ongoing compliance regulatory requirement procurement maintenance construction environmental operational license approval additional expansion potential supply chain constraint hiring training retention qualified employee pace bringing production equipment process online capability manufacture highquality unit scale . For example currently constructing Gigafactory Berlin conditional permit anticipation granted final permit . Moreover establish ramp production proprietary battery cell pack new factory additionally intend incorporate sequential design manufacturing change vehicle manufactured new factory . We limited experience date developing implementing manufacturing innovation outside Fremont Factory Gigafactory Shanghai . In particular majority design engineering resource currently located California . In order meet expectation new factory must expand manage localized design engineering talent resource . If experience issue delay meeting projected timeline cost capital efficiency production capacity new factory expanding managing team implement iterative design production change maintaining complying term debt financing obtain fund generating maintaining demand vehicle manufacture business prospect operating result financial condition may harmed . We need maintain significantly grow access battery cell including development manufacture cell control related cost .

While implemented security measure intended prevent unauthorized access information technology network product system malicious entity reportedly attempted may attempt future gain unauthorized access modify alter use network product system gain control change product functionality user interface performance characteristic gain access data stored generated product . We encourage reporting potential vulnerability security product security vulnerability reporting policy aim remedy reported verified vulnerability . However assurance vulnerability exploited identified remediation effort successful . Any unauthorized access control product system loss data could result legal claim government investigation . In addition regardless veracity report unauthorized access product system data well factor may result perception product system data capable hacked may harm brand prospect operating result . We subject report past . Our business may adversely affected disruption caused union activity . It uncommon employee certain trade company u belong union result higher employee cost increased risk work stoppage . Moreover regulation jurisdiction outside U.S. mandate employee participation industrial collective bargaining agreement work council certain consultation right respect relevant company operation . Although work diligently provide best possible work environment employee may still decide join seek recognition form labor union may required become union signatory . From time time labor union engaged campaign organize certain operation part union filed unfair labor practice charge u National Labor Relations Board NLRB may future . In September 2019 administrative law judge issued recommended decision Tesla certain issue u certain others . In March 2021 NLRB adopted portion recommendation overturned others . Tesla appealed decision United States Circuit Court Fifth Circuit currently pending . Any unfavorable ultimate outcome Tesla may negative impact perception Teslas treatment employee . Furthermore directly indirectly dependent upon company unionized work force supplier trucking freight company . Any work stoppage strike organized union could delay manufacture sale product may harm business operating result . We may choose compelled undertake product recall take similar action . As manufacturing company must manage risk product recall respect product . Recalls vehicle resulted example industrywide issue airbags particular supplier concern corrosion certain Model S Model X power steering assist motor bolt suspension failure certain Model S Model X issue certain Model S Model X medium control unit torqueing bolt internal specification certain Model 3 Model Y misalignment frunk latch assembly certain Model S unavailability rearview camera display certain Model 3 . In addition recall initiated u various cause testing investigation product government regulator industry group may compel u initiate product recall may result negative public perception safety product even disagree defect determination data show actual safety risk nonexistent . In future may voluntarily involuntarily initiate recall product determined u regulator contain safety defect noncompliant applicable law regulation U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standard . Such recall whether voluntary involuntary caused system component engineered manufactured u supplier could result significant expense supply chain complication service burden may harm brand business prospect financial condition operating result . Our current future warranty reserve may insufficient cover future warranty claim . We provide manufacturer warranty new used Tesla vehicle sell . We also provide certain warranty respect energy generation storage system sell including installation maintenance . For component manufactured u generally pas customer applicable manufacturer warranty may retain warranty responsibility life component . As part energy generation storage system contract may provide customer performance guarantee guarantee underlying system meet exceed minimum energy generation energy performance requirement specified contract . Under performance guarantee generally bear risk electricity production performance shortfall even result failure component 21 third party manufacturer . These risk exacerbated event manufacturer cease operation fail honor warranty . If warranty reserve inadequate cover future warranty claim product financial condition operating result may harmed . Warranty reserve include management best estimate projected cost repair replace item warranty based actual claim incurred date estimate nature frequency cost future claim . Such estimate inherently uncertain change historical projected experience especially respect product Model 3 Model Y Solar Roof introduced relatively recently andor expect produce significantly greater volume past product may cause material change warranty reserve future . Our insurance coverage strategy may adequate protect u business risk . We may subject ordinary course business loss resulting product liability accident act God claim u may insurance coverage . As general matter maintain much insurance coverage many company case maintain . Additionally policy may include significant deductible selfinsured retention policy limitation exclusion certain insurance coverage sufficient cover future loss claim u . A loss uninsured exceeds policy limit may require u pay substantial amount may harm financial condition operating result . Our debt agreement contain covenant restriction may limit ability operate business . The term certain credit facility including senior assetbased revolving credit agreement contain future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction limit ability operate business including restriction ability among thing incur additional debt issue guarantee create lien repurchase stock make restricted payment make certain voluntary prepayment specified debt . In addition certain circumstance required comply fixed charge coverage ratio . As result covenant ability respond change business economic condition engage beneficial transaction including obtain additional financing needed may restricted . Furthermore failure comply debt covenant could result default debt agreement could permit holder accelerate obligation repay debt . If debt accelerated may sufficient fund available repay . Additional fund may available u need want . Our business future plan expansion capitalintensive specific timing cash inflow outflow may fluctuate substantially period period . We may need want raise additional fund issuance equity equityrelated debt security obtaining credit financial institution fund together principal source liquidity cost developing manufacturing current future product pay significant unplanned accelerated expense new significant strategic investment refinance significant consolidated indebtedness even required term indebtedness . We certain additional fund available u favorable term required . If raise additional fund need financial condition result operation business prospect could materially adversely affected . We may negatively impacted early obsolescence manufacturing equipment . We depreciate cost manufacturing equipment expected useful life . However product cycle manufacturing technology may change periodically may decide update product manufacturing process quickly expected . Moreover improvement engineering manufacturing expertise efficiency may result ability manufacture product using le currently installed equipment . Alternatively ramp mature production product higher level may discontinue use already installed equipment favor different additional equipment . The useful life equipment would retired early result would shortened causing depreciation equipment accelerated result operation may harmed . We hold may acquire digital asset may subject volatile market price impairment unique risk loss . In January 2021 updated investment policy provide u flexibility diversify maximize return cash required maintain adequate operating liquidity allowing u invest portion cash certain alternative reserve asset including digital asset gold bullion gold exchangetraded fund asset specified future . Thereafter invested certain cash bitcoin also accepted bitcoin form payment sale certain product specified region subject applicable law suspended practice May 2021 . We believe longterm potential digital asset investment also liquid alternative cash . As investment consistent manage fiatbased cash cash equivalent account may increase decrease holding digital asset time based need business view market environmental condition . 22 The price digital asset past may continue highly volatile including result various associated risk uncertainty . For example prevalence asset relatively recent trend longterm adoption investor consumer business unpredictable . Moreover lack physical form reliance technology creation existence transactional validation decentralization may subject integrity threat malicious attack technological obsolescence . Finally extent security law regulation apply may apply future asset unclear may change future . If hold digital asset value decrease relative purchase price financial condition may harmed . Moreover digital asset currently considered indefinitelived intangible asset applicable accounting rule meaning decrease fair value carrying value asset time subsequent acquisition require u recognize impairment charge whereas may make upward revision market price increase sale may adversely affect operating result period impairment occurs . Moreover guarantee future change GAAP require u change way account digital asset held u . Finally intangible asset without centralized issuer governing body digital asset may future subject security breach cyberattacks malicious activity well human error computer malfunction may result loss destruction private key needed access asset . While intend take reasonable measure secure digital asset threat realized measure control create implement secure digital asset fail could result partial total misappropriation loss digital asset financial condition operating result may harmed . There guarantee sufficient cash flow business pay indebtedness incur additional indebtedness . As December 31 2021 subsidiary outstanding 5.38 billion aggregate principal amount indebtedness see Note 11 Debt consolidated financial statement included elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . Our consolidated indebtedness may increase vulnerability generally adverse economic industry condition . We subsidiary may subject limitation term existing future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing future debt recapitalize debt . Our ability make scheduled payment principal interest indebtedness due make payment upon conversion repurchase demand respect convertible senior note refinance indebtedness may need desire depends future performance subject economic financial competitive factor beyond control . Our business may continue generate cash flow operation future sufficient satisfy obligation existing indebtedness future indebtedness may incur make necessary capital expenditure . If unable generate cash flow may required adopt one alternative reducing delaying investment capital expenditure selling asset refinancing obtaining additional equity capital term may onerous highly dilutive . Our ability refinance existing future indebtedness depend capital market financial condition time . In addition ability make payment may limited law regulatory authority agreement governing future indebtedness . We may able engage activity desirable term may result default existing future indebtedness harm financial condition operating result . We exposed fluctuation currency exchange rate . We transact business globally multiple currency foreign currency risk related revenue cost revenue operating expense localized subsidiary debt denominated currency U.S. dollar currently primarily Chinese yuan euro Canadian dollar Norwegian krone . To extent significant revenue denominated foreign currency strengthening U.S. dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar historically experienced . In addition portion cost expense anticipate continue denominated foreign currency including Chinese yuan Japanese yen . If fully offsetting revenue currency value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . Moreover undertake limited hedging activity intended offset impact currency translation exposure impossible predict eliminate impact . As result operating result may harmed . We may need defend intellectual property infringement claim may timeconsuming expensive . Our competitor third party may hold obtain patent copyright trademark proprietary right could prevent limit interfere ability make use develop sell market product service could make difficult u operate business . From time time holder intellectual property right may assert right urge u take license andor may bring suit alleging infringement misappropriation right could result 23 substantial cost negative publicity management attention regardless merit . While endeavor obtain protect intellectual property right expect allow u retain advance strategic initiative assurance able adequately identify protect portion intellectual property strategic business mitigate risk potential suit legal demand competitor . Accordingly may consider entering licensing agreement respect right although assurance given license obtained acceptable term litigation occur license associated litigation could significantly increase operating expense . In addition determined believe high likelihood infringed upon third party intellectual property right may required cease making selling incorporating certain component intellectual property good service offer pay substantial damage andor license royalty redesign product service andor establish maintain alternative branding product service . In event required take one action brand business financial condition operating result may harmed . Increased scrutiny changing expectation stakeholder respect Companys ESG practice may result additional cost risk . Companies across many industry facing increasing scrutiny related ESG practice . Investor advocacy group certain institutional investor investment fund influential investor also increasingly focused ESG practice recent year placed increasing importance nonfinancial impact investment . While mission accelerate world transition sustainable energy ESG practice meet investor industry stakeholder expectation continue evolve may incur additional cost brand ability attract retain qualified employee business may harmed . Our operation could adversely affected event outside control natural disaster war health epidemic . We may impacted natural disaster war health epidemic weather condition longterm effect climate change power outage event outside control . For example Fremont Factory Gigafactory Nevada located seismically active region Northern California Nevada Gigafactory Shanghai located floodprone area . Moreover area Gigafactory Texas located experienced severe winter storm first quarter 2021 widespread impact utility transportation . If major disaster earthquake flood climaterelated event occur information system communication break operates improperly headquarters production facility may seriously damaged may stop delay production shipment product . In addition global COVID19 pandemic impacted economic market manufacturing operation supply chain employment consumer behavior nearly every geographic region industry across world may future adversely affected result . We may incur expense delay relating event outside control could material adverse impact business operating result financial condition . Risks Related Government Laws Regulations Demand product service may impacted status government economic incentive supporting development adoption product . Government economic incentive support development adoption electric vehicle U.S. abroad including certain tax exemption tax credit rebate may reduced eliminated exhausted time time . For example previously available incentive favoring electric vehicle area including Ontario Canada Germany Hong Kong Denmark California expired cancelled temporarily unavailable case eventually replaced reinstituted may negatively impacted sale . Certain government economic incentive may also implemented provide disproportionate benefit manufacturer assemble domestically local supplier characteristic may apply Tesla . Any similar development could negative impact demand vehicle customer may adjust . In addition certain governmental rebate tax credit financial incentive currently available respect solar energy storage product business allow u lower cost encourage customer buy product investor invest solar financing fund . However incentive may expire allocated funding exhausted reduced terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase sometimes without warning . For example U.S. federal government currently offer certain tax credit installation solar power facility energy storage system charged cosited solar power facility however tax credit currently scheduled decline andor expire 2023 beyond . Likewise jurisdiction net metering currently available customer receive bill credit utility energy solar energy system generate export grid excess electric load use . The benefit available net metering proposed reduced altered eliminated several jurisdiction also contested may continue contested Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . Any reduction termination incentive may harm business prospect financial condition operating result making product le competitive customer 24 increasing cost capital adversely impacting ability attract investment partner form new financing fund solar energy storage asset . Finally fund investor claim U.S. federal tax credit certain state incentive amount based independently appraised fair market value solar energy storage system . Some governmental authority audited value certain case determined value lower may future . Such determination may result adverse tax consequence andor obligation make indemnification payment fund fund investor . We subject evolving law regulation could impose substantial cost legal prohibition unfavorable change upon operation product . As grow manufacturing operation additional region subject complex environmental manufacturing health safety law regulation numerous jurisdictional level U.S. China Germany location abroad including law relating use handling storage recycling disposal andor human exposure hazardous material product material input postconsumer product respect constructing expanding maintaining facility . New change environmental climate change law regulation rule could also lead increased cost compliance including remediation discovered issue change operation may significant failure comply could result significant expense delay fine . In addition increased employee headcount operation may continue subject increased scrutiny including litigation government investigation relating allegation discrimination workplace misconduct need defend . If unable successfully defend litigation government investigation may harm brand ability attract retain qualified employee business financial condition . We also subject law regulation applicable supply manufacture import sale service product domestically abroad . For example country outside U.S. required meet standard relating vehicle safety fuel economy emission often materially different requirement U.S. thus resulting additional investment vehicle system ensure regulatory compliance country . This process may include official review certification vehicle foreign regulatory agency prior market entry well compliance foreign reporting recall management system requirement . In particular offer vehicle Autopilot FSD Capability feature today assist driver certain tedious potentially dangerous aspect road travel currently require driver remain fully engaged driving operation . We continuing develop FSD Capability technology goal achieving fully selfdriving capability future . There variety international federal state regulation may apply sale registration operation fully selfdriving vehicle include many existing vehicle standard originally intended apply vehicle may human driver . Such regulation continue rapidly change increase likelihood patchwork complex conflicting regulation may delay product restrict selfdriving feature availability could adversely affect business . Finally manufacturer installer service provider respect solar generation energy storage system supplier electricity generated stored certain solar energy energy storage system install customer provider grid service virtual power plant model impacted federal state local regulation policy concerning electricity pricing interconnection electricity generation storage equipment electrical grid sale electricity generated third partyowned system . If regulation policy adversely impact interconnection use solar energy storage system introduced could deter potential customer purchasing solar energy storage product service threaten economics existing contract cause u cease solar energy storage system sale service relevant jurisdiction may harm business financial condition operating result . Any failure u comply variety U.S. international privacy consumer protection law may harm u . Any failure u vendor business partner comply public privacy notice federal state international privacy data protection security law regulation relating processing collection use retention security transfer personally identifiable information could result regulatory litigationrelated action u legal liability fine damage ongoing audit requirement significant cost . Substantial expense operational change may required connection maintaining compliance law even unsuccessful challenge customer regulatory authority activity could result adverse publicity could require costly response defense u . In addition certain emerging privacy law still subject high degree uncertainty interpretation application impact may require extensive system operational change difficult implement increase operating cost adversely impact cost attractiveness product service offer result adverse publicity harm reputation . For example General Data Protection Regulation applies processing personal information collected individual located European Union created new compliance obligation significantly increased fine noncompliance . Similarly California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligation use processing personal information related California resident . Finally new privacy cybersecurity law come effect China . Notwithstanding effort protect security integrity customer personal information may required expend significant resource comply data 25 breach requirement example third party improperly obtain use personal information customer otherwise experience data loss respect customer personal information . A major breach network security system may result fine penalty damage harm brand prospect operating result . We could subject liability penalty restrictive sanction adverse consequence arising certain governmental investigation proceeding . We cooperating certain government investigation discussed Note 15 Commitments Contingencies consolidated financial statement included elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . To knowledge government agency ongoing investigation concluded wrongdoing occurred . However predict outcome impact ongoing matter exists possibility could subject liability penalty restrictive sanction adverse consequence SEC U.S. Department Justice government agency pursue legal action future . Moreover expect incur cost responding related request information subpoena instituted defending governmental proceeding . For example October 16 2018 U.S. District Court Southern District New York entered final judgment approving term settlement filed Court September 29 2018 connection action taken SEC relating Mr. Musks statement August 7 2018 considering taking Tesla private . Pursuant settlement among thing paid civil penalty 20 million appointed independent director chair board director appointed two additional independent director board director made enhancement disclosure control corporate governancerelated matter . On April 26 2019 settlement amended clarify certain previouslyagreed disclosure procedure subsequently approved Court . All term prior settlement reaffirmed without modification . Although intend continue comply term requirement settlement lack compliance alleged lack compliance additional enforcement action legal proceeding may instituted u . We may face regulatory challenge limitation ability sell vehicle directly . While intend continue leverage effective sale strategy including sale website may able sell vehicle store certain state U.S. law may interpreted impose limitation directtoconsumer sale model . It also asserted law state limit ability obtain dealer license state motor vehicle regulator assertion persist . In certain location decision regulator permitting u sell vehicle may challenged dealer association others whether decision comply applicable state motor vehicle industry law . We prevailed many lawsuit result reinforced continuing belief state law intended apply manufacturer franchise dealer . In state also regulatory legislative effort dealer association propose law enacted would prevent u obtaining dealer license state given current sale model . A state passed legislation clarifies ability operate time limit number dealer license obtain store operate . The application state law applicable operation continues difficult predict . Internationally may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict sale business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . Continued regulatory limitation obstacle interfering ability sell vehicle directly consumer may harm financial condition operating result .

We expect periodtoperiod financial result vary based operating cost anticipate fluctuate pace continue design develop manufacture new product increase production capacity expanding current manufacturing facility adding future facility may consistent linear period . Additionally revenue period period may fluctuate introduce existing product new market first time develop introduce new product . As result factor believe quartertoquarter comparison financial result especially short term necessarily meaningful comparison relied upon indicator future performance . Moreover financial result may meet expectation equity research analyst rating agency investor may focused shortterm quarterly financial result . If occurs trading price stock could fall substantially either suddenly time . We may fail meet publicly announced guidance expectation business could cause stock price decline . We may provide time time guidance regarding expected financial business performance . Correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition predicting future event inherently uncertain process guidance may ultimately accurate past inaccurate certain respect timing new product manufacturing ramp . Our guidance based certain assumption relating anticipated production sale volume generally linear throughout given period average sale price supplier commodity cost planned cost reduction . If guidance varies actual result due assumption met impact financial performance could occur result various risk uncertainty market value common stock could decline significantly . Transactions relating convertible senior note may dilute ownership interest existing stockholder may otherwise depress price common stock . The conversion convertible senior note issued u subsidiary would dilute ownership interest existing stockholder extent deliver share upon conversion note holder may required deliver significant number share . Any sale public market common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market price . In addition existence convertible senior note may encourage short selling market participant conversion note could used satisfy short position anticipated conversion note share common stock could depress price common stock . If Elon Musk forced sell share common stock pledged secure certain personal loan obligation sale could cause stock price decline . Certain banking institution made extension credit Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer portion used purchase share common stock certain public offering private placement price offered thirdparty participant offering placement . We party loan partially secured pledge portion Tesla common stock currently owned Mr. Musk . If price common stock decline substantially Mr. Musk may forced one banking institution sell share Tesla common stock satisfy loan obligation could mean .
