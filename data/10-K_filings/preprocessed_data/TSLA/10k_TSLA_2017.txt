Finally successfully monitor comply applicable national state andor local financial regulation consumer protection law governing lease transaction may become subject enforcement action penalty either may harm business . 22 The unavailability reduction elimination unfavorable determination respect government economic incentive U.S. abroad supporting development adoption electric vehicle solar energy could impact demand product service . We currently benefit certain government economic incentive supporting development adoption electric vehicle . In U.S. abroad incentive include among thing tax credit rebate encourage purchase electric vehicle . In Norway example purchase electric vehicle currently subject import tax tax nonrecurring vehicle fee 25 value added tax purchase tax apply purchase gaspowered vehicle . Notably quantum incentive program promoting electric vehicle tiny fraction amount subsidy provided gaspowered vehicle oil gas industry . Nevertheless even limited benefit program could reduced eliminated exhausted . For example April 2017 January 2016 respectively previously available incentive Hong Kong Denmark favored purchase electric vehicle expired negatively impacting sale . Moreover current regulation 7500 federal tax credit available U.S. purchase qualified electric vehicle least 17 kWh battery capacity vehicle begin phase time respect vehicle delivered second calendar quarter following quarter deliver 200000th qualifying vehicle U.S. We currently expect 200000th qualifying delivery occur point 2018 . In addition California implemented regulation phasing 2500 cash rebate qualified electric vehicle highincome consumer became effective March 2016 . In certain circumstance pressure oil gas lobby related special interest bring development could negative impact demand vehicle . In addition certain governmental rebate tax credit financial incentive currently available respect solar energy storage product business allow u lower installation cost cost capital encourage customer buy product investor invest solar financing fund . However incentive may expire particular date end allocated funding exhausted reduced terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase often without warning . For example federal government currently offer 30 investment tax credit ITC installation solar power facility energy storage system charged cosited solar power facility . The ITC currently scheduled decline 10 expire altogether residential system January 2022 . Likewise jurisdiction net energy metering currently available customer receive bill credit utility energy solar energy system generate export grid excess electric load use . Several jurisdiction reduced eliminated benefit available net energy metering proposed . Such reduction termination governmental incentive could adversely impact result making product le competitive potential customer increasing cost capital adversely impacting ability attract investment partner form new financing fund solar energy storage asset . Additionally enactment Tax Cuts Jobs Act U.S. could potentially increase cost decrease availability renewable energy financing reducing value depreciation benefit associated overall investor tax capacity needed monetize renewable energy project . Such change could lower overall investment willingness capacity project available market . Moreover fund investor claim ITC amount based fair market value solar energy storage system . Although obtain independent appraisal support claimed fair market value relevant governmental authority audited value certain case determined lower may future . Such determination may result adverse tax consequence andor obligation make indemnification payment contribute additional asset fund fund investor . Any failure u realize expected benefit substantial investment commitment respect manufacture PV cell module including unable comply term agreement Research Foundation State University New York relating Gigafactory 2 could result negative consequence business . We certain PV cell module manufacturing technology asset buildtosuit lease arrangement Research Foundation State University New York SUNY Foundation .

Under agreement obligated among thing employ specified 23 minimum number personnel State New York spend incur 5.0 billion combined capital operational expense cost good sold cost State New York 10year period following completion construction related infrastructure arrival manufacturing equipment receipt certain permit specified item Gigafactory 2 . If fail year course term agreement meet obligation would obligated pay program payment 41.2 million SUNY Foundation year . Any inability part comply requirement agreement may result payment significant amount SUNY Foundation termination lease Gigafactory 2 andor need secure alternative supply PV cell module product Solar Roof . Moreover unable utilize manufacturing technology asset accordance expectation may recognize accounting charge pertaining writeoff asset . Any foregoing event could material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . If unable attract andor retain key employee hire qualified personnel ability compete could harmed . The loss service key employee could disrupt operation delay development introduction vehicle service negatively impact business prospect operating result . In particular highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technical Officer . None key employee bound employment agreement specific term may able successfully attract retain senior leadership necessary grow business . Our future success depends upon ability attract retain executive officer key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing support personnel failure could adversely impact business prospect financial condition operating result . Key talent may leave Tesla due various factor competitive labor market talented individual automotive technology experience . In California Nevada region operation increasing competition individual skillsets needed business including specialized knowledge electric vehicle software engineering manufacturing engineering skill electrical building construction expertise . This competition affect ability retain key employee hire new one . Our continued success depends upon continued ability hire new employee timely manner especially support expansion plan ramp highvolume manufacture vehicle retain current employee . Additionally compete mature prosperous company far greater financial resource startup emerging company promise shortterm growth opportunity . Difficulties retaining current employee recruiting new one could adverse effect performance . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer Chairman Board Directors largest stockholder . Although Mr. Musk spends significant time Tesla highly active management devote full time attention Tesla . Mr. Musk also currently serf Chief Executive Officer Chief Technical Officer Space Exploration Technologies developer manufacturer space launch vehicle involved emerging technology venture . On February 8 2018 filed proxy statement U.S. Securities Exchange Commission pursuant seeking stockholder approval grant January 2018 10year performancebased stock option award Mr. Musk forfeited approved CEO Performance Award . Mr. Musk currently compensation Tesla prior performancebased stock option award granted Mr. Musk 2012 vested 9 10 tranche statemandated minimum wage salary never accepted . There assurance CEO Performance Award receive stockholder approval . We subject various environmental safety law regulation could impose substantial cost upon u negatively impact ability operate manufacturing facility . As manufacturing company including respect facility Tesla Factory Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory 2 subject complex environmental health safety law regulation numerous 24 jurisdictional level U.S. abroad including law relating use handling storage disposal human exposure hazardous material . The cost compliance including remediating contamination found property change operation mandated new amended law may significant . We may also face unexpected delay obtaining permit approval required law connection manufacturing facility would hinder operation facility . Such cost delay may adversely impact business prospect operating result . Furthermore violation law may result substantial fine penalty remediation cost third party damage suspension cessation operation . Our business may adversely affected disruption caused union activity . It common employee company significant manufacturing operation u belong union result higher employee cost increased risk work stoppage . Moreover regulation jurisdiction outside U.S. mandate employee participation industrial collective bargaining agreement work council certain consultation right respect relevant company operation . Although work diligently provide best possible work environment employee may still decide join seek recognition form labor union may required become union signatory . The United Automobile Workers publicly announced desire organize Tesla Factory engaged campaign company . Furthermore directly indirectly dependent upon company unionized work force part supplier trucking freight company work stoppage strike organized union could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result . If work stoppage occurs could delay manufacture sale product material adverse effect business prospect operating result financial condition . Our product service subject substantial regulation evolving unfavorable change failure u comply regulation could substantially harm business operating result . Motor vehicle subject substantial regulation international federal state local law . We incur significant cost complying regulation may required incur additional cost comply change regulation failure comply could result significant expense delay fine . We subject law regulation applicable manufacture import sale service automobile internationally . For example country outside U.S. required meet standard relating vehicle safety fuel economy emission among thing often materially different requirement U.S. thus resulting additional investment vehicle system ensure regulatory compliance country . This process may include official review certification vehicle foreign regulatory agency prior market entry well compliance foreign reporting recall management system requirement . Additionally vehicle equipped suite driverassistance feature called autopilot help assist driver certain tedious potentially dangerous aspect road travel require driver remain engaged . There variety international federal state regulation may apply selfdriving vehicle include many existing vehicle standard originally intended apply vehicle may driver . Such regulation continue rapidly change increase likelihood patchwork complex conflicting regulation may delay product restrict selfdriving feature availability could adversely affect business . Moreover manufacturer installer solar generation energy storage system supplier electricity generated stored solar energy energy storage system install customer impacted federal state local regulation policy concerning electricity pricing interconnection electricity generation storage equipment electric grid sale electricity generated thirdparty owned system . For example existing proposed regulation policy would permit utility limit amount electricity generated customer solar energy system charge fee penalty customer relating purchase energy grid adjust electricity rate design price solar product may competitive electricity grid restrict u customer transacting PPAs qualifying government incentive benefit apply solar power limit eliminate net energy metering . If regulation policy remain effect adopted jurisdiction regulation policy adversely impact interconnection solar energy storage system grid introduced modified eliminated could deter potential customer 25 purchasing solar energy storage product threaten economics existing contract cause u cease solar energy storage system sale operation relevant jurisdiction could harm business prospect financial condition result operation . We subject various privacy consumer protection law . Our privacy policy posted website failure u vendor business partner comply federal state international privacy data protection security law regulation could result regulatory litigationrelated action u legal liability fine damage cost . We may also incur substantial expense cost connection maintaining compliance law . For example commencing May 2018 General Data Protection Regulation GDPR fully apply processing personal information collected individual located European Union . The GDPR create new compliance obligation significantly increase fine noncompliance . Although take step protect security customer personal information may required expend significant resource comply data breach requirement third party improperly obtain use personal information customer otherwise experience data loss respect customer personal information . A major breach network security system could negative consequence business future prospect including possible fine penalty damage reduced customer demand vehicle harm reputation brand . We may compelled undertake product recall take action could adversely affect brand image financial performance . Any product recall including solar charging equipment future may result adverse publicity damage brand adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . For example certain limited vehicle recall initiated past two year resulted component could prevent parking brake releasing engaged concern firmware restraint control module certain righthanddrive vehicle industrywide issue airbags particular supplier front seat belt issue single field vehicle Model X seat component could cause unintended seat movement collision . Furthermore testing vehicle government regulator industry group may require u initiate vehicle recall may result negative public perception safety vehicle . In future may various time voluntarily involuntarily initiate recall product electric vehicle powertrain component provided vehicle OEMs including system part sourced supplier prove defective noncompliant applicable law regulation federal motor vehicle safety standard . Such recall whether voluntary involuntary caused system component engineered manufactured u supplier could involve significant expense could adversely affect brand image target market well business prospect financial condition result operation . Our resale value guarantee leasing program vehicle expose u risk resale value vehicle returned u lower estimate may result lower revenue gross margin profitability liquidity . We provided resale value guarantee many customer customer may sell vehicle back u certain point time predetermined resale value . If resale value vehicle resold returned u pursuant program materially lower estimate profitability andor liquidity could negatively impacted . We applied lease accounting lease made directly u prior 2018 lease made leasing partner sale u vehicle resale value guarantee . Under lease accounting recognize associated revenue cost vehicle sale time rather fully upfront vehicle delivery . As result program generate lower revenue period car delivered higher gross margin period resale value guarantee compared purchase resale value guarantee apply . A higher anticipated prevalence program could therefore adverse impact near term revenue operating result . Moreover unlike sale vehicle resale value guarantee program leasing partner impact cash flow liquidity time vehicle delivery lease held directly u may receive small portion total vehicle purchase price time lease followed stream payment term lease . To extent expand leasing program without securing 26 external financing business partner support expansion cash flow liquidity could also negatively impacted . Our current future warranty reserve may insufficient cover future warranty claim could adversely affect financial performance .
