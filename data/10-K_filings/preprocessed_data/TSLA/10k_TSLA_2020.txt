We made past may make future certain adjustment price time time ordinary course business may impact residual value vehicle reduce profitability vehicle leasing program . The funding growth program also relies ability secure adequate financing andor business partner . If unable adequately fund leasing program internal fund partner financing source compelling alternative financing program available customer may expect need option may unable grow vehicle delivery . Furthermore vehicle leasing business grows substantially business may suffer effectively manage resulting greater level residual risk . Similarly provided resale value guarantee vehicle customer partner certain financing program counterparties may sell vehicle back u certain point time predetermined amount . However actual resale value subject fluctuation term financing arrangement vehicle pricing change discussed . If actual resale value vehicle resold returned u pursuant program materially lower predetermined amount offered financial condition operating result may harmed . Finally vehicle solar energy system financing program energy storage sale program also expose u customer credit risk . In event widespread economic downturn catastrophic event customer may unable unwilling satisfy payment obligation u timely basis . If significant number customer default may incur substantial credit loss andor impairment charge respect underlying asset . We must manage ongoing obligation agreement Research Foundation State University New York relating Gigafactory New York . We party operating lease research development agreement SUNY Foundation . These agreement provide construction use Gigafactory New York primarily used development production Solar Roof solar product component energy storage component Supercharger component lessorapproved function . Under agreement obligated among thing meet employment target well specified minimum number personnel State New York Buffalo New York spend incur 5.00 billion combined capital operational expense cost good sold cost State New York 10year period beginning April 30 2018 .

While expect grow significant operation Gigafactory New York surrounding Buffalo area failure u year course term agreement meet applicable future obligation may result obligation pay program payment 41 million SUNY Foundation year termination lease Gigafactory New York may require u pay additional penalty andor need adjust certain operation particular production ramp Solar Roof component . Any foregoing event may harm business financial condition operating result . If unable attract hire retain key employee qualified personnel ability compete may harmed . The loss service key employee significant portion workforce could disrupt operation delay development introduction ramp product service . In particular highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . None key employee bound employment agreement specific term may able successfully attract retain senior leadership necessary grow business . Our future success also depends upon ability attract hire retain large number engineering manufacturing marketing sale delivery service installation technology support personnel especially support planned highvolume product sale market geographical 19 expansion technological innovation . Recruiting effort particularly senior employee may timeconsuming may delay execution plan . If successful managing risk business financial condition operating result may harmed . Employees may leave Tesla choose employer Tesla due various factor competitive labor market talented individual automotive technology experience negative publicity related u . In California Nevada region operation increasing competition individual skillsets needed business including specialized knowledge electric vehicle software engineering manufacturing engineering electrical building construction expertise . Moreover may impacted perception relating reduction force conducted past order optimize organizational structure reduce cost departure certain senior personnel various reason . Likewise result temporary suspension various U.S. manufacturing operation first half 2020 April 2020 temporarily furloughed certain hourly employee reduced salaried employee base salary . We also compete mature prosperous company far greater financial resource startup emerging company promise shortterm growth opportunity . Finally compensation philosophy personnel reflects startup origin emphasis equitybased award benefit order closely align incentive longterm interest stockholder . We periodically seek obtain approval stockholder future increase number award available equity incentive employee stock purchase plan . If unable obtain requisite stockholder approval future increase may expend additional cash compensate employee ability retain hire qualified personnel may harmed . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer largest stockholder . Although Mr. Musk spends significant time Tesla highly active management devote full time attention Tesla . Mr. Musk also currently serf Chief Executive Officer Chief Technical Officer Space Exploration Technologies Corp. developer manufacturer space launch vehicle involved emerging technology venture . We must manage risk relating information technology system threat intellectual property theft data breach cyberattacks . We must continue expand improve information technology system operation grow product data management procurement inventory management production planning execution sale service logistics dealer management financial tax regulatory compliance system . This includes implementation new internally developed system deployment system U.S. abroad . We must also continue maintain information technology measure designed protect u intellectual property theft data breach sabotage external internal cyberattacks misappropriation . However implementation maintenance segregation improvement system require significant management time support cost inherent risk associated developing improving expanding core system well implementing new system updating current system including disruption related area business operation . These risk may affect ability manage data inventory procure part supply manufacture sell deliver service product adequately protect intellectual property achieve maintain compliance realize available benefit tax law applicable regulation . Moreover successfully implement maintain expand system planned operation may disrupted ability accurately andor timely report financial result could impaired deficiency may arise internal control financial reporting may impact ability certify financial result . Moreover proprietary information intellectual property could compromised misappropriated reputation may adversely affected . If system functionality operate expect may required expend significant resource make correction find alternative source performing function . Any unauthorized control manipulation product system could result loss confidence u product . Our product contain complex information technology system . For example vehicle energy storage product designed builtin data connectivity accept install periodic remote update u improve update functionality . While implemented security measure intended prevent unauthorized access information technology network product system malicious entity reportedly attempted may attempt future gain unauthorized access modify alter use network product system gain control change product functionality user interface performance characteristic gain access data stored generated product . We encourage reporting potential vulnerability security product security vulnerability reporting policy aim remedy reported verified vulnerability . However assurance vulnerability exploited identified remediation effort successful . 20 Any unauthorized access control product system loss data could result legal claim government investigation . In addition regardless veracity report unauthorized access product system data well factor may result perception product system data capable hacked may harm brand prospect operating result . We subject report past . Our business may adversely affected disruption caused union activity . It uncommon employee certain trade company u belong union result higher employee cost increased risk work stoppage . Moreover regulation jurisdiction outside U.S. mandate employee participation industrial collective bargaining agreement work council certain consultation right respect relevant company operation . Although work diligently provide best possible work environment employee may still decide join seek recognition form labor union may required become union signatory . From time time labor union engaged campaign organize certain operation part union filed unfair labor practice charge u National Labor Relations Board may future . In September 2019 administrative law judge issued recommended decision Tesla certain issue u certain others . The National Labor Relations Board yet adopted recommendation appealed certain aspect recommended decision . Any unfavorable ultimate outcome Tesla may negative impact perception Teslas treatment employee . Furthermore directly indirectly dependent upon company unionized work force supplier trucking freight company . Any work stoppage strike organized union could delay manufacture sale product may harm business operating result . We may choose compelled undertake product recall take similar action . As manufacturing company must manage risk product recall respect product . Recalls vehicle resulted example industrywide issue airbags particular supplier concern corrosion Model S Model X power steering assist motor bolt certain suspension failure Model S Model X issue Model S Model X medium control unit . In addition recall initiated u various cause testing investigation product government regulator industry group may compel u initiate product recall may result negative public perception safety product even disagree defect determination data show actual safety risk nonexistent . In future may voluntarily involuntarily initiate recall product determined u regulator contain safety defect noncompliant applicable law regulation U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standard . Such recall whether voluntary involuntary caused system component engineered manufactured u supplier could result significant expense supply chain complication service burden may harm brand business prospect financial condition operating result . Our current future warranty reserve may insufficient cover future warranty claim . We provide manufacturer warranty new used Tesla vehicle sell . We also provide certain warranty respect energy generation storage system sell including installation maintenance component manufactured u generally pas customer applicable manufacturer warranty . As part energy generation storage system contract may provide customer performance guarantee warrant underlying system meet exceed minimum energy generation energy performance requirement specified contract . Under performance guarantee bear risk electricity production performance shortfall even result failure component third party manufacturer . These risk exacerbated event manufacturer cease operation fail honor warranty . If warranty reserve inadequate cover future warranty claim product financial condition operating result may harmed . Warranty reserve include management best estimate projected cost repair replace item warranty based actual claim incurred date estimate nature frequency cost future claim . Such estimate inherently uncertain change historical projected experience especially respect product Model 3 Model Y Solar Roof recently introduced andor expect produce significantly greater volume past product may cause material change warranty reserve future . Our insurance coverage strategy may adequate protect u business risk . We may subject ordinary course business loss resulting product liability accident act God claim u may insurance coverage . As general matter maintain much insurance coverage many company case maintain . Additionally policy may include significant deductible selfinsured retention policy limitation exclusion certain insurance coverage sufficient cover future loss claim u . A loss uninsured exceeds policy limit may require u pay substantial amount may harm financial condition operating result . 21 There guarantee sufficient cash flow business pay substantial indebtedness incur additional indebtedness . As December 31 2020 subsidiary outstanding 10.57 billion aggregate principal amount indebtedness see Note 12 Debt consolidated financial statement included elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase vulnerability generally adverse economic industry condition . We subsidiary may subject limitation term existing future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing future debt recapitalize debt . Holders convertible senior note issued u subsidiary may convert note option prior scheduled maturity respective convertible senior note certain circumstance pursuant term note . Upon conversion applicable convertible senior note obligated deliver cash andor share pursuant term note . For example stock price significantly increased recently seen higher level early conversion inthemoney convertible senior note . Moreover holder convertible senior note may right require u repurchase note upon occurrence fundamental change pursuant term note . Our ability make scheduled payment principal interest indebtedness due make payment upon conversion repurchase demand respect convertible senior note refinance indebtedness may need desire depends future performance subject economic financial competitive factor beyond control . Our business may continue generate cash flow operation future sufficient satisfy obligation existing indebtedness future indebtedness may incur make necessary capital expenditure . If unable generate cash flow may required adopt one alternative reducing delaying investment capital expenditure selling asset refinancing obtaining additional equity capital term may onerous highly dilutive . Our ability refinance existing future indebtedness depend capital market financial condition time . In addition ability make payment may limited law regulatory authority agreement governing future indebtedness . We may able engage activity desirable term may result default existing future indebtedness harm financial condition operating result . Our debt agreement contain covenant restriction may limit ability operate business . The term certain credit facility including senior assetbased revolving credit agreement contain future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction limit ability operate business including restriction ability among thing incur additional debt issue guarantee create lien repurchase stock make restricted payment make certain voluntary prepayment specified debt . In addition certain circumstance required comply fixed charge coverage ratio . As result covenant ability respond change business economic condition engage beneficial transaction including obtain additional financing needed may restricted . Furthermore failure comply debt covenant could result default debt agreement could permit holder accelerate obligation repay debt . If debt accelerated may sufficient fund available repay . Additional fund may available u need want . Our business future plan expansion capitalintensive specific timing cash inflow outflow may fluctuate substantially period period . We may need want raise additional fund issuance equity equityrelated debt security obtaining credit financial institution fund together principal source liquidity cost developing manufacturing current future product pay significant unplanned accelerated expense new significant strategic investment refinance significant consolidated indebtedness even required term indebtedness . We certain additional fund available u favorable term required . If raise additional fund need financial condition result operation business prospect could materially adversely affected . We may negatively impacted early obsolescence manufacturing equipment . We depreciate cost manufacturing equipment expected useful life . However product cycle manufacturing technology may change periodically may decide update product manufacturing process quickly expected . Moreover improvement engineering manufacturing expertise efficiency may result ability manufacture product using le currently installed equipment . Alternatively ramp mature production product higher level may discontinue use already installed equipment favor different additional equipment . The useful life equipment would retired early result would shortened causing depreciation equipment accelerated result operation may harmed . 22 We hold may acquire digital asset may subject volatile market price impairment unique risk loss . In January 2021 updated investment policy provide u flexibility diversify maximize return cash required maintain adequate operating liquidity . As part policy duly approved Audit Committee Board Directors may invest portion cash certain alternative reserve asset including digital asset gold bullion gold exchangetraded fund asset specified future . Thereafter invested aggregate 1.50 billion bitcoin policy may acquire hold digital asset time time longterm . Moreover expect begin accepting bitcoin form payment product near future subject applicable law initially limited basis may may liquidate upon receipt . The price digital asset past may continue highly volatile including result various associated risk uncertainty . For example prevalence asset relatively recent trend longterm adoption investor consumer business unpredictable . Moreover lack physical form reliance technology creation existence transactional validation decentralization may subject integrity threat malicious attack technological obsolescence . Finally extent security law regulation apply may apply future asset unclear may change future . If hold digital asset value decrease relative purchase price financial condition may harmed . Moreover digital asset currently considered indefinitelived intangible asset applicable accounting rule meaning decrease fair value carrying value asset time subsequent acquisition require u recognize impairment charge whereas may make upward revision market price increase sale may adversely affect operating result period impairment occurs . Moreover guarantee future change GAAP require u change way account digital asset held u . Finally intangible asset without centralized issuer governing body digital asset may future subject security breach cyberattacks malicious activity well human error computer malfunction may result loss destruction private key needed access asset . While intend take reasonable measure secure digital asset threat realized measure control create implement secure digital asset fail could result partial total misappropriation loss digital asset financial condition operating result may harmed . We exposed fluctuation currency exchange rate . We transact business globally multiple currency foreign currency risk related revenue cost revenue operating expense localized subsidiary debt denominated currency U.S. dollar currently primarily Chinese yuan euro Canadian dollar British pound . To extent significant revenue denominated foreign currency strengthening U.S. dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar historically experienced . In addition portion cost expense anticipate continue denominated foreign currency including Chinese yuan Japanese yen . If fully offsetting revenue currency value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . Moreover undertake limited hedging activity intended offset impact currency translation exposure impossible predict eliminate impact . As result operating result may harmed . We may need defend intellectual property infringement claim may timeconsuming expensive . Our competitor third party may hold obtain patent copyright trademark proprietary right could prevent limit interfere ability make use develop sell market product service could make difficult u operate business . From time time holder intellectual property right may assert right urge u take license andor may bring suit alleging infringement misappropriation right could result substantial cost negative publicity management attention regardless merit . While endeavor obtain protect intellectual property right expect allow u retain advance strategic initiative assurance able adequately identify protect portion intellectual property strategic business mitigate risk potential suit legal demand competitor . Accordingly may consider entering licensing agreement respect right although assurance given license obtained acceptable term litigation occur license associated litigation could significantly increase operating expense . In addition determined believe high likelihood infringed upon third party intellectual property right may required cease making selling incorporating certain component intellectual property good service offer pay substantial damage andor license royalty redesign product service andor establish maintain alternative 23 branding product service . In event required take one action brand business financial condition operating result may harmed . Our operation could adversely affected event outside control natural disaster war health epidemic . We may impacted natural disaster war health epidemic event outside control . For example corporate headquarters Fremont Factory Gigafactory Nevada located seismically active region Northern California Nevada Gigafactory Shanghai located floodprone area . If major disaster earthquake flood event occur information system communication network break operates improperly headquarters production facility may seriously damaged may stop delay production shipment product . In addition global COVID19 pandemic impacted economic market manufacturing operation supply chain employment consumer behavior nearly every geographic region industry across world may future adversely affected result . We may incur expense delay relating event outside control could material adverse impact business operating result financial condition . Risks Related Government Laws Regulations Demand product service may impacted status government economic incentive supporting development adoption product . Government economic incentive support development adoption electric vehicle U.S. abroad including certain tax exemption tax credit rebate may reduced eliminated exhausted time time . For example 7500 federal tax credit available U.S. purchase vehicle reduced phase ultimately ended 2019 . We believe sequential phaseout likely pulled forward vehicle demand period preceding reduction . Moreover previously available incentive favoring electric vehicle area including Ontario Canada Germany Hong Kong Denmark California expired cancelled temporarily unavailable case eventually replaced reinstituted may negatively impacted sale . Any similar development could negative impact demand vehicle customer may adjust . In addition certain governmental rebate tax credit financial incentive currently available respect solar energy storage product business allow u lower cost encourage customer buy product investor invest solar financing fund . However incentive may expire allocated funding exhausted reduced terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase sometimes without warning . For example U.S. federal government currently offer certain tax credit installation solar power facility energy storage system charged cosited solar power facility however tax credit currently scheduled decline andor expire 2023 beyond . Likewise jurisdiction net metering currently available customer receive bill credit utility energy solar energy system generate export grid excess electric load use . The benefit available net metering proposed reduced altered eliminated several jurisdiction also contested may continue contested FERC . Any reduction termination incentive may harm business prospect financial condition operating result making product le competitive potential customer increasing cost capital adversely impacting ability attract investment partner form new financing fund solar energy storage asset . Finally fund investor claim U.S. federal tax credit certain state incentive amount based independently appraised fair market value solar energy storage system . Nevertheless relevant governmental authority audited value certain case determined value lower may future . Such determination may result adverse tax consequence andor obligation make indemnification payment fund fund investor . We subject evolving law regulation could impose substantial cost legal prohibition unfavorable change upon operation product . As grow manufacturing operation additional region subject complex environmental manufacturing health safety law regulation numerous jurisdictional level U.S. China Germany location abroad including law relating use handling storage recycling disposal andor human exposure hazardous material product material input postconsumer product respect constructing expanding maintaining facility . The cost compliance including remediation discovered issue change operation mandated new amended law may significant failure comply could result significant expense delay fine . We also subject law regulation applicable supply manufacture import sale service automobile domestically abroad . For example country outside U.S. required meet standard relating vehicle safety fuel economy 24 emission often materially different requirement U.S. thus resulting additional investment vehicle system ensure regulatory compliance country . This process may include official review certification vehicle foreign regulatory agency prior market entry well compliance foreign reporting recall management system requirement . In particular offer vehicle Autopilot FSD feature today assist driver certain tedious potentially dangerous aspect road travel currently require driver remain fully engaged driving operation . We continuing develop FSD technology goal achieving full selfdriving capability future . There variety international federal state regulation may apply selfdriving vehicle include many existing vehicle standard originally intended apply vehicle may driver . Such regulation continue rapidly change increase likelihood patchwork complex conflicting regulation may delay product restrict selfdriving feature availability could adversely affect business . Finally manufacturer installer service provider respect solar generation energy storage system supplier electricity generated stored solar energy energy storage system install customer impacted federal state local regulation policy concerning electricity pricing interconnection electricity generation storage equipment electric grid sale electricity generated third partyowned system . If regulation policy adversely impact interconnection use solar energy storage system introduced could deter potential customer purchasing solar energy storage product threaten economics existing contract cause u cease solar energy storage system sale operation relevant jurisdiction may harm business financial condition operating result . Any failure u comply variety U.S. international privacy consumer protection law may harm u . Any failure u vendor business partner comply public privacy notice federal state international privacy data protection security law regulation relating processing collection use retention security transfer personally identifiable information could result regulatory litigationrelated action u legal liability fine damage ongoing audit requirement significant cost . Substantial expense operational change may required connection maintaining compliance law particular certain emerging privacy law still subject high degree uncertainty interpretation application . For example May 2018 General Data Protection Regulation began fully apply processing personal information collected individual located European Union created new compliance obligation significantly increased fine noncompliance . Similarly January 2020 California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligation use processing personal information related California resident . Finally new privacy cybersecurity law coming effect China . Notwithstanding effort protect security integrity customer personal information may required expend significant resource comply data breach requirement example third party improperly obtain use personal information customer otherwise experience data loss respect customer personal information . A major breach network security system may result fine penalty damage harm brand prospect operating result . We could subject liability penalty restrictive sanction adverse consequence arising certain governmental investigation proceeding . We cooperating certain government investigation discussed Note 16 Commitments Contingencies consolidated financial statement included elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . To knowledge government agency ongoing investigation concluded wrongdoing occurred . However predict outcome impact ongoing matter exists possibility could subject liability penalty restrictive sanction adverse consequence SEC U.S. Department Justice government agency pursue legal action future . Moreover expect incur cost responding related request information subpoena instituted defending governmental proceeding . For example October 16 2018 U.S. District Court Southern District New York entered final judgment approving term settlement filed Court September 29 2018 connection action taken SEC relating Mr. Musks statement August 7 2018 considering taking Tesla private . Pursuant settlement among thing paid civil penalty 20 million appointed independent director chair board director appointed two additional independent director board director made enhancement disclosure control corporate governancerelated matter . On April 26 2019 settlement amended clarify certain previouslyagreed disclosure procedure subsequently approved Court . All term prior settlement reaffirmed without modification . Although intend continue comply term requirement settlement lack compliance alleged lack compliance additional enforcement action legal proceeding may instituted u . 25 We may face regulatory challenge limitation ability sell vehicle directly . While intend continue leverage effective sale strategy including sale website may able sell vehicle store certain state U.S. law may interpreted impose limitation directtoconsumer sale model . It also asserted law state limit ability obtain dealer license state motor vehicle regulator assertion persist . In certain location decision regulator permitting u sell vehicle may challenged dealer association others whether decision comply applicable state motor vehicle industry law . We prevailed many lawsuit result reinforced continuing belief state law intended apply manufacturer franchise dealer . In state also regulatory legislative effort dealer association propose law enacted would prevent u obtaining dealer license state given current sale model . A state passed legislation clarifies ability operate time limit number dealer license obtain store operate . The application state law applicable operation continues difficult predict . Internationally may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict sale business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . Continued regulatory limitation obstacle interfering ability sell vehicle directly consumer may harm financial condition operating result . Risks Related Ownership Our Common Stock The trading price common stock likely continue volatile .

Our common stock experienced last 52 week intraday trading high 900.40 per share low 70.10 per share adjusted give effect reflect fiveforone stock split effected form stock dividend August 2020 Stock Split . The stock market general market technology company particular experienced extreme price volume fluctuation often unrelated disproportionate operating performance company . In particular large proportion common stock historically may future traded short seller may put pressure supply demand common stock influencing volatility market price . Public perception factor outside control may additionally impact stock price company like u garner disproportionate degree public attention regardless actual operating performance . In addition past following period volatility overall market market price share security class action litigation filed u . While defend action vigorously judgment u future stockholder litigation could result substantial cost diversion management attention resource . Our financial result may vary significantly period period due fluctuation operating cost factor . We expect periodtoperiod financial result vary based operating cost anticipate fluctuate pace continue design develop manufacture new product increase production capacity expanding current manufacturing facility adding future facility may consistent linear period . Additionally revenue period period may fluctuate introduce existing product new market first time develop introduce new product . As result factor believe quartertoquarter comparison financial result especially short term necessarily meaningful comparison relied upon indicator future performance . Moreover financial result may meet expectation equity research analyst rating agency investor may focused shortterm quarterly financial result . If occurs trading price stock could fall substantially either suddenly time . We may fail meet publicly announced guidance expectation business could cause stock price decline . We may provide time time guidance regarding expected financial business performance . Correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition predicting future event inherently uncertain process guidance may ultimately accurate past inaccurate certain respect timing new product manufacturing ramp . Our guidance based certain assumption relating anticipated production sale volume generally linear throughout given period average sale price supplier commodity cost planned cost reduction . If guidance varies actual result due assumption met impact financial performance could occur result various risk uncertainty market value common stock could decline significantly . 26 Transactions relating convertible senior note may dilute ownership interest existing stockholder may otherwise depress price common stock . The conversion convertible senior note issued u subsidiary would dilute ownership interest existing stockholder extent deliver share upon conversion note holder may required deliver significant number share . Any sale public market common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market price . In addition existence convertible senior note may encourage short selling market participant conversion note could used satisfy short position anticipated conversion note share common stock could depress price common stock . Moreover connection certain convertible senior note entered convertible note hedge transaction expected reduce potential dilution andor offset potential cash payment required make excess principal amount upon conversion applicable note . We also entered warrant transaction hedge counterparties could separately dilutive effect common stock extent market price per share common stock exceeds applicable strike price warrant applicable expiration date . In addition hedge counterparties affiliate may enter various transaction respect hedge position could also affect market price common stock convertible senior note .
