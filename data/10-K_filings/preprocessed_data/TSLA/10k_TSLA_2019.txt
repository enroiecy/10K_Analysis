If unsuccessful effort control reduce supplier cost operating result suffer . Outside U.S. limited manufacturing experience may experience issue delay increasing level localized procurement Gigafactory Shanghai future Gigafactory Berlin . Furthermore scale vehicle production increase need accurately forecast purchase warehouse transport component manufacturing facility servicing location internationally much higher volume . If unable accurately match timing quantity component purchase actual need successfully implement automation inventory management system accommodate increased complexity supply chain may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation writeoff cost could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Any problem delay expanding Gigafactory Nevada ramping maintaining operation could negatively affect production profitability product Model 3 Model Y energy storage product . In addition battery cell produced store large amount energy . To lower cost cell production produce cell high volume vertically integrated production lithiumion cell Gigafactory Nevada also manufacture battery pack drive unit certain vehicle energy storage product assemble Megapack product . Production lithiumion cell Gigafactory Nevada began 2017 direct experience production lithiumion cell . Given size complexity undertaking possible future event could result issue delay ramping product expanding production output Gigafactory Nevada . 18 In order achieve volume gross margin target vehicle energy storage product must continue sustain ramp significant cell production Gigafactory Nevada among thing requires Panasonic successfully operate ramp cell production line significant volume . Although Panasonic long track record producing highquality cell significant volume factory Japan relatively limited experience cell production Gigafactory Nevada . In addition produce several component Model 3 Model Y battery module incorporating lithiumion cell produced Panasonic drive unit including support Gigafactory Shanghai production Gigafactory Nevada . Some manufacturing line component took longer anticipated ramp full capacity . While largely overcome bottleneck deploying multiple semiautomated line improving original line additional bottleneck may arise continue increase production rate introduce new line . If unable maintain Gigafactory Nevada production ramp output additionally time needed costeffectively Panasonic unable hire retain substantial number highly skilled personnel ability supply battery pack component Model 3 Model Y product could negatively impacted could negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition high volume lithiumion cell battery module pack manufactured Gigafactory Nevada stored recycled various facility . Any mishandling battery cell may cause disruption operation facility . While implemented safety procedure related handling cell assurance safety issue fire related cell would disrupt operation . Such disruption issue could negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Any issue delay meeting projected timeline cost production funding ramp Gigafactory Shanghai difficulty generating maintaining local demand vehicle manufactured could adversely impact business prospect operating result financial condition . As part continuing work increase production vehicle sustained basis order make affordable international market accessing local supply chain workforce established Gigafactory Shanghai China . Currently installed annual production capacity 150000 Model 3 vehicle believe eventually able push actual rate production excess number commenced construction next phase Gigafactory Shanghai add Model Y manufacturing capacity least equivalent Model 3 . The ramp expansion Gigafactory Shanghai subject number uncertainty inherent new manufacturing operation including ongoing compliance regulatory requirement maintenance operational license approval additional expansion potential supply chain constraint hiring training retention qualified employee pace bringing production equipment process online capability manufacture highquality unit scale . We limited experience date operating manufacturing facility abroad recently began sell Model 3 China . If experience issue delay meeting projected timeline cost capital efficiency production capacity Gigafactory Shanghai maintaining complying term local debt financing intend largely fund generating maintaining demand locally vehicle manufacture Gigafactory Shanghai business prospect operating result financial condition could adversely impacted . In particular local manufacturing critical expansion sale China largest market electric vehicle world . Our vehicle sale China negatively impacted past certain tariff automobile manufactured U.S. vehicle cost producing vehicle U.S. also affected import duty certain component sourced China . If able successfully timely ramp Gigafactory Shanghai may continue exposed impact unfavorable tariff duty cost detriment compared locallybased competitor . 19 We face risk associated international operation including unfavorable uncertain regulatory political economic tax labor condition establishing new market could harm business . We global footprint domestic international operation subsidiary . Accordingly subject variety legal political regulatory requirement social environmental economic condition little control . For example may impacted trade policy environmental condition political uncertainty economic cycle involving geographic region significant operation inherently unpredictable . We subject number risk associated particular international business activity may increase cost impact ability sell product require significant management attention . These risk include conforming product various international regulatory safety requirement well charging electric infrastructure organizing local operating entity difficulty establishing staffing managing foreign operation challenge attracting customer foreign government tax regulation permit requirement ability enforce contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff price exchange control preference foreign nation domestically manufactured product . Increases cost disruption supply shortage material particular lithiumion cell could harm business . We may experience increase cost sustained interruption supply shortage material . Any increase supply interruption shortage could materially negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We use various material business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper cobalt well lithiumion cell supplier . The price material fluctuate available supply may unstable depending market condition global demand material including result increased production electric vehicle energy storage product competitor could adversely affect business operating result . For instance exposed multiple risk relating lithiumion cell . These risk include increase cost decrease available supply material used cell disruption supply cell due quality issue recall battery cell manufacturer issue may arise respect cell manufactured facility fluctuation value foreign currency battery cell related raw material purchase may denominated Japanese yen U.S. dollar . Our business dependent continued supply battery cell battery pack used vehicle energy storage product . While believe several source battery cell available battery pack expect eventually rely substantially battery cell manufactured facility date fully qualified limited number supplier cell used battery pack limited flexibility changing cell supplier . Any disruption supply battery cell supplier could disrupt production vehicle battery pack produce energy product time different supplier fully qualified . Furthermore fluctuation shortage petroleum economic condition may cause u experience significant increase freight charge material cost . Substantial increase price material price charged u charged battery cell supplier would increase operating cost could reduce margin recoup increased cost increased vehicle price . Any attempt increase product price response increased material cost could result cancellation order reservation therefore materially adversely affect brand image business prospect operating result . 20 If vehicle product sell install fail perform expected ability develop market sell product service could harmed . If vehicle energy product contain defect design manufacture cause perform expected require repair certain feature vehicle new Autopilot FSD feature take longer expected become enabled legally restricted become subject onerous regulation ability develop market sell product service could harmed . For example operation vehicle highly dependent software inherently complex may contain latent defect error subject external attack . Issues experienced vehicle customer included related software 17 inch display screen well panoramic roof 12volt battery Model S seat door Model X . Although attempt remedy issue observe product effectively rapidly possible effort may timely may hamper production may satisfaction customer . While performed extensive internal testing product manufacture currently limited frame reference evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability performance characteristic battery pack powertrains vehicle energy storage product . There assurance able detect fix defect product prior sale installation customer . Any product defect delay legal restriction product feature failure product perform expected could harm reputation result delivery delay product recall product liability claim breach warranty claim significant warranty expense could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . We may become subject product liability claim could harm financial condition liquidity able successfully defend insure claim . Although design vehicle safest vehicle road product liability claim even without merit could harm business prospect operating result financial condition . The automobile industry particular experience significant product liability claim face inherent risk exposure claim event vehicle perform claimed performed expected . As true automaker vehicle involved expect future involved crash resulting death personal injury crash Autopilot FSD feature engaged subject significant public attention . We experienced expect continue face claim arising related misuse claimed failure new technology pioneering including Autopilot FSD feature vehicle . In addition battery pack produce make use lithiumion cell . On rare occasion lithiumion cell rapidly release energy contain venting smoke flame manner ignite nearby material well lithiumion cell . While designed battery pack passively contain single cell release energy without spreading neighboring cell assurance field testing failure vehicle battery pack produce occur particular due highspeed crash could subject u lawsuit product recall redesign effort would time consuming expensive . Moreover solar energy system energy storage product generate store electricity potential cause injury people property . A successful product liability claim u could require u pay substantial monetary award . Our risk area particularly pronounced given relatively limited number vehicle energy storage product delivered date limited field experience product . Moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity product business could material adverse effect brand business prospect operating result . In jurisdiction generally selfinsure risk product liability claim vehicle exposure meaning product liability claim likely paid company fund insurance . 21 The market operate highly competitive may successful competing industry . We currently face competition new established domestic international competitor expect face competition others future including competition company new technology . The worldwide automotive market particularly alternative fuel vehicle highly competitive today expect become even future . There assurance vehicle successful respective market compete . A significant growing number established new automobile manufacturer well company entered reported plan enter alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid fully electric vehicle well market selfdriving technology application . In case competitor announced intention produce electric vehicle exclusively point future . Most current potential competitor significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sale resource network may able devote greater resource design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale support product . In particular competitor also announced plan compete u important large market electric vehicle China Europe . Increased competition could result lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss customer loss market share could harm business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition Model 3 Model Y face competition existing future automobile manufacturer extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan compact SUV market including BMW Ford Lexus Mercedes Volkswagen Group . The solar energy storage industry highly competitive . We face competition manufacturer developer installers solar energy storage system well large utility . Decreases retail price electricity utility renewable energy source could make product le attractive customer lead increased rate customer default existing longterm lease PPAs . Moreover price solar product component price per kWh lithiumion battery cell declined may continue decline may adversely impact ability costeffectively manufacture component . If unable establish maintain confidence longterm business prospect among consumer analyst within industry subject negative publicity financial condition operating result business prospect access capital may suffer materially . Consumers may le likely purchase product convinced business succeed service support operation continue long term . Similarly supplier third party le likely invest time resource developing business relationship u convinced business succeed . Accordingly order build maintain business must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst rating agency party longterm financial viability business prospect . Maintaining confidence may particularly complicated certain factor including largely outside control limited operating history customer unfamiliarity product delay scaling manufacturing delivery service operation meet demand competition uncertainty regarding future electric vehicle product service quarterly production sale performance compared market expectation . In particular Teslas product business result operation statement action wellpublicized range third party . Such attention includes frequent criticism often exaggerated unfounded speculation regarding sufficiency stability management team . Any negative perception whether caused u could harm business make difficult raise additional fund needed . 22 If fail effectively grow manage residual financing credit risk related vehicle financing program business may suffer . We offer financing arrangement vehicle North America Europe Asia primarily various financial institution . We also currently offer leasing directly local subsidiary Model S Model X Model 3 U.S. Model S Model X Canada . Under lease held directly u typically receive small portion total vehicle purchase price time lease followed stream payment term lease . The profitability vehicle returned u end lease depends ability accurately project vehicle residual value outset lease value may fluctuate prior end term depending various factor supply demand used vehicle economic cycle pricing new vehicle . For example made certain adjustment vehicle price 2019 reflect anticipated change cost structure periodically optimizing retail strategy limited accommodation customer consideration reduction electric vehicle federal tax credit . Such pricing change may impact residual value vehicle . The leasing program also relies ability secure adequate financing andor business partner fund grow program screen manage customer credit risk . We expect availability leasing financing option important vehicle customer . If unable adequately fund leasing program internal fund partner external financing source compelling alternative financing program available customer may unable grow delivery . Furthermore leasing business grows substantially business may suffer effectively manage greater level residual credit risk resulting growth . Finally successfully monitor comply applicable national state andor local financial regulation consumer protection law governing lease transaction may become subject enforcement action penalty either may harm business . Moreover provided resale value guarantee customer partner certain financing program counterparties may sell vehicle back u certain point time predetermined amount . However actual resale value residual value leased vehicle subject similar fluctuation term financing arrangement vehicle pricing change discussed . If actual resale value vehicle resold returned u pursuant program materially lower predetermined amount offered operating result profitability andor liquidity could negatively impacted . The unavailability reduction elimination unfavorable determination respect government economic incentive U.S. abroad supporting development adoption electric vehicle energy storage product solar energy could impact demand product service . We customer currently benefit certain government economic incentive supporting development adoption electric vehicle . In U.S. abroad incentive include tax credit rebate encourage purchase electric vehicle . Specific policy place around world include exempting purchase electric vehicle import tax value added tax carbon dioxide weightbased purchase tax . Such program could reduced eliminated exhausted . For example current regulation 7500 federal tax credit available U.S. purchase vehicle reduced phase 2019 ended December 31 2019 . We believe sequential phaseout likely pulled forward vehicle demand period preceding reduction . Moreover July 2018 previously available incentive purchase Model 3 Ontario Canada cancelled Tesla buyer Germany lost access electric vehicle incentive short period time beginning late 2017 . In April 2017 January 2016 respectively previously available incentive Hong Kong Denmark favored purchase electric vehicle expired negatively impacting sale . Effective March 2016 California implemented regulation phasing 2500 cash rebate qualified electric vehicle highincome consumer . Such development could negative impact demand vehicle customer may adjust . 23 In addition certain governmental rebate tax credit financial incentive currently available respect solar energy storage product business allow u lower cost encourage customer buy product investor invest solar financing fund . However incentive may expire particular date allocated funding exhausted reduced terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase sometimes without warning . For example U.S. federal government currently offer investment tax credit ITC installation solar power facility energy storage system charged cosited solar power facility however ITC currently scheduled decline phase 26 qualifying solar system construction began December 31 2020 10 commercial utility system 0 customerowned residential system construction begin December 31 2021 . Likewise jurisdiction net energy metering currently available customer receive bill credit utility energy solar energy system generate export grid excess electric load use . Several jurisdiction reduced altered eliminated benefit available net energy metering proposed . Such reduction termination governmental incentive could adversely impact result making product le competitive potential customer increasing cost capital adversely impacting ability attract investment partner form new financing fund solar energy storage asset . Moreover fund investor claim ITC certain state incentive amount based fair market value solar energy storage system . Although obtain independent appraisal support claimed fair market value relevant governmental authority audited value certain case determined lower may future . Such determination may result adverse tax consequence andor obligation make indemnification payment fund fund investor . Any failure u comply term agreement Research Foundation State University New York relating Gigafactory New York could result negative consequence business . We party operating lease research development agreement SUNY Foundation . These agreement provide construction use Gigafactory Buffalo New York primarily used development production Solar Roof solar product component energy storage component Supercharger component lessorapproved function . Under agreement obligated among thing directly employ specified minimum number personnel State New York spend incur 5.0 billion combined capital operational expense cost good sold cost State New York 10year period beginning April 30 2018 . While expect significant operation Gigafactory New York surrounding Buffalo area continue including ramp manufacture Solar Roof fail year course term agreement meet obligation would obligated pay program payment 41.2 million SUNY Foundation year . Any inability part comply requirement agreement may result payment significant amount SUNY Foundation termination lease Gigafactory New York andor need adjust certain operation particular production ramp Solar Roof Supercharger component . Any foregoing event could material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . If unable attract andor retain key employee hire qualified personnel ability compete could harmed . The loss service key employee could disrupt operation delay development introduction vehicle service negatively impact business prospect operating result . In particular highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . None key employee bound employment agreement specific term may able successfully attract retain senior leadership necessary grow business . Our future success depends upon ability attract retain executive officer key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing support personnel especially support highvolume manufacture vehicle expansion plan technological innovation failure delay could adversely impact business prospect financial condition operating result . 24 Key talent may leave Tesla due various factor competitive labor market talented individual automotive technology experience negative publicity related u . In California Nevada region operation including outside U.S. increasing competition individual skillsets needed business including specialized knowledge electric vehicle software engineering manufacturing engineering skill electrical building construction expertise . This competition affect ability retain hire key employee . Moreover past conducted reduction force order optimize organizational structure reduce cost certain senior personnel also departed various reason . Our continued success depends upon continued ability hire new employee timely manner especially support expansion plan retain current employee replace departed senior employee qualified experienced individual typically timeconsuming process . Additionally compete mature prosperous company far greater financial resource startup emerging company promise shortterm growth opportunity . Difficulties retaining recruiting employee could adverse effect performance result . Finally compensation philosophy personnel reflects startup origin emphasis equitybased award benefit order closely align incentive longterm interest stockholder . We periodically seek obtain approval stockholder future increase number award may granted share may purchased equity incentive employee stock purchase plan . If unable obtain requisite stockholder approval obtain future increase number award may granted share may purchased plan compensate personnel accordance compensation philosophy ability retain hire qualified personnel would negatively impacted . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer largest stockholder . Although Mr. Musk spends significant time Tesla highly active management devote full time attention Tesla . Mr. Musk also currently serf Chief Executive Officer Chief Technical Officer Space Exploration Technologies Corp. developer manufacturer space launch vehicle involved emerging technology venture . We continuously expanding improving information technology system use security measure designed protect system breach cyberattacks . If effort successful business operation could disrupted intellectual property could compromised result operating result reputation could harmed . We continuously expanding improving information technology system including implementing new internally developed system deploying system globally assist u management business . In particular volume production multiple vehicle necessitates continued development maintenance improvement information technology system U.S. abroad including Gigafactory Shanghai system product data management procurement inventory management production planning execution sale service logistics dealer management financial tax regulatory compliance system . We also maintain information technology measure designed protect u intellectual property theft data breach cyberattacks . The implementation maintenance segregation improvement system require significant management time support cost . Moreover inherent risk associated developing improving expanding core system well implementing new system updating current system including disruption data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain sale service process . These risk may affect ability manage data inventory procure part supply manufacture sell deliver service vehicle adequately protect intellectual property achieve maintain compliance realize available benefit tax law applicable regulation . 25 We sure system required functionality effectively implemented maintained expanded planned . If successfully implement maintain expand system planned operation may disrupted ability accurately andor timely report financial result could impaired deficiency may arise internal control financial reporting may impact ability certify financial result . Moreover proprietary information intellectual property could compromised misappropriated reputation may adversely affected . If system functionality operate expect may required expend significant resource make correction find alternative source performing function . Any unauthorized control manipulation product system could result loss confidence u product harm business . Our product contain complex information technology system . For example vehicle energy storage product designed builtin data connectivity accept install periodic remote update u improve update functionality . We designed implemented tested security measure intended prevent unauthorized access information technology network product system . However hacker reportedly attempted may attempt future gain unauthorized access modify alter use network product system gain control change product functionality user interface performance characteristic gain access data stored generated product . We encourage reporting potential vulnerability security product via security vulnerability reporting policy aim remedy reported verified vulnerability . Accordingly received report potential vulnerability past attempted remedy . However assurance vulnerability exploited future identified remediation effort successful . Any unauthorized access control product system loss data could result legal claim proceeding . In addition regardless veracity report unauthorized access product system data well factor may result perception product system data capable hacked could negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . We subject report past . We subject substantial law regulation could impose substantial cost legal prohibition unfavorable change upon operation product failure comply law regulation including evolve could negatively impact ability operate manufacturing facility substantially harm business operating result . As manufacturing company including respect current facility Fremont Factory Gigafactory Nevada Gigafactory New York Gigafactory Shanghai future facility Gigafactory Berlin subject complex environmental manufacturing health safety law regulation numerous jurisdictional level U.S. China Germany location abroad including law relating use handling storage recycling disposal human exposure hazardous material respect constructing expanding maintaining facility . The cost compliance including remediating contamination found property change operation mandated new amended law may significant . We may also face unexpected delay obtaining permit approval required law connection manufacturing facility would hinder operation facility . Such cost delay may adversely impact business prospect operating result . Furthermore violation law may result substantial fine penalty remediation cost third party damage suspension cessation operation . 26 In addition motor vehicle subject substantial regulation international federal state local law . We incur significant cost complying regulation may required incur additional cost comply change regulation failure comply could result significant expense delay fine . We subject law regulation applicable supply manufacture import sale service automobile internationally . For example country outside U.S. required meet standard relating vehicle safety fuel economy emission among thing often materially different requirement U.S. thus resulting additional investment vehicle system ensure regulatory compliance country . This process may include official review certification vehicle foreign regulatory agency prior market entry well compliance foreign reporting recall management system requirement . In particular offer vehicle Autopilot FSD feature today assist driver certain tedious potentially dangerous aspect road travel currently require driver remain engaged . We continuing develop FSD technology goal achieving full selfdriving capability future . There variety international federal state regulation may apply selfdriving vehicle include many existing vehicle standard originally intended apply vehicle may driver . Such regulation continue rapidly change increase likelihood patchwork complex conflicting regulation may delay product restrict selfdriving feature availability could adversely affect business . Finally manufacturer installer solar generation energy storage system supplier electricity generated stored solar energy energy storage system install customer impacted federal state local regulation policy concerning electricity pricing interconnection electricity generation storage equipment electric grid sale electricity generated thirdparty owned system . For example existing proposed regulation policy would permit utility limit amount electricity generated customer solar energy system charge fee penalty customer relating purchase energy grid adjust electricity rate design price solar product may competitive electricity grid restrict u customer transacting PPAs qualifying government incentive benefit apply solar power limit eliminate net energy metering . If regulation policy adopted regulation policy adversely impact interconnection use solar energy storage system introduced could deter potential customer purchasing solar energy storage product threaten economics existing contract cause u cease solar energy storage system sale operation relevant jurisdiction could harm business prospect financial condition result operation . Failure comply variety U.S. international privacy consumer protection law subject could harm Company . Our privacy policy posted website failure u vendor business partner comply federal state international privacy data protection security law regulation relating collection use retention security transfer personally identifiable information could result regulatory litigationrelated action u legal liability fine damage ongoing audit requirement significant cost . Substantial expense operational change may required connection maintaining compliance law particular certain emerging privacy law still subject high degree uncertainty interpretation application . For example May 2018 General Data Protection Regulation began fully apply processing personal information collected individual located European Union created new compliance obligation significantly increased fine noncompliance . Similarly beginning January 2020 California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligation use processing personal information related California resident . Although take step protect security integrity customer personal information may required expend significant resource comply data breach requirement third party improperly obtain use personal information customer otherwise experience data loss respect customer personal information . A major breach network security system could negative consequence business future prospect including possible fine penalty damage reduced customer demand vehicle harm reputation brand . 27 Our business may adversely affected disruption caused union activity . It uncommon employee certain trade company u belong union result higher employee cost increased risk work stoppage . Moreover regulation jurisdiction outside U.S. mandate employee participation industrial collective bargaining agreement work council certain consultation right respect relevant company operation . Although work diligently provide best possible work environment employee may still decide join seek recognition form labor union may required become union signatory . From time time labor union engaged campaign organize certain operation part union filed unfair labor practice charge u National Labor Relations Board may future . In September 2019 administrative law judge issued recommended decision Tesla certain issue u certain others . The National Labor Relations Board yet adopted recommendation appealed certain aspect recommended decision . Any unfavorable ultimate outcome Tesla may negative impact perception Teslas treatment employee . Furthermore directly indirectly dependent upon company unionized work force part supplier trucking freight company work stoppage strike organized union could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result . If work stoppage occurs could delay manufacture sale product material adverse effect business prospect operating result financial condition . We may choose compelled undertake product recall take similar action could adversely affect brand image financial performance . Any product recall respect product may result adverse publicity damage brand adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . For example certain vehicle recall initiated resulted various cause including component could prevent parking brake releasing engaged concern firmware restraint control module certain righthanddrive vehicle industrywide issue airbags particular supplier Model X seat component could cause unintended seat movement collision concern corrosion Model S Model X power steering assist motor bolt . Furthermore testing product government regulator industry group may require u initiate product recall may result negative public perception safety product . In future may various time voluntarily involuntarily initiate recall product electric vehicle powertrain component provided vehicle OEMs including system part sourced supplier prove defective noncompliant applicable law regulation federal motor vehicle safety standard . Such recall whether voluntary involuntary caused system component engineered manufactured u supplier could involve significant expense could adversely affect brand image target market well business prospect financial condition result operation . Our current future warranty reserve may insufficient cover future warranty claim could adversely affect financial performance . We provide manufacturer warranty new used Tesla vehicle production powertrain component system sell . In addition also provide warranty installation component energy generation storage system sell pas customer inverter panel manufacturer warranty . Finally offer performance guarantee leased solar energy system compensates customer annual basis system meet electricity production guarantee set forth PPA lease . Under performance guarantee bear risk electricity production shortfall resulting inverter panel failure . These risk exacerbated event panel inverter manufacturer cease operation fail honor warranty . If warranty reserve inadequate cover future warranty claim product business prospect financial condition operating result could materially adversely affected . Warranty reserve include management best estimate projected cost repair replace item warranty . These estimate based actual claim incurred date estimate nature frequency cost future claim . Such estimate inherently uncertain change historical projected experience especially respect product Model 3 Model Y Solar Roof recently introduced andor expect produce significantly greater volume past product may cause material change warranty reserve future . 28 Our insurance coverage strategy may adequate protect u business risk . We may subject ordinary course business loss resulting product liability accident act God claim u may insurance coverage . As general matter maintain much insurance coverage many company case maintain . Additionally policy may include significant deductible selfinsured retention certain insurance coverage sufficient cover future loss claim u . A loss uninsured exceeds policy limit may require u pay substantial amount could adversely affect financial condition operating result . Our financial result may vary significantly period period due fluctuation operating cost factor . We expect periodtoperiod financial result vary based operating cost anticipate fluctuate pace continue design develop manufacture new product increase production capacity expanding current manufacturing facility adding future facility may consistent linear period . Additionally revenue period period may fluctuate introduce existing product new market first time develop introduce new product . As result factor believe quartertoquarter comparison financial result especially short term necessarily meaningful comparison relied upon indicator future performance . Moreover financial result may meet expectation equity research analyst rating agency investor may focused quarterly financial result . If occurs trading price stock could fall substantially either suddenly time . Servicing indebtedness requires significant amount cash guarantee sufficient cash flow business pay substantial indebtedness . As December 31 2019 subsidiary outstanding 12.49 billion aggregate principal amount indebtedness see Note 12 Debt consolidated financial statement included elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase vulnerability generally adverse economic industry condition . We subsidiary may subject limitation term existing future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing future debt recapitalize debt . Pursuant term holder 1.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 2.375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 2.00 Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 together Tesla Convertible Notes may convert respective Tesla Convertible Notes option prior scheduled maturity respective Tesla Convertible Notes certain circumstance . Upon conversion applicable Tesla Convertible Notes obligated deliver cash andor share respect principal amount thereof conversion value excess principal amount Tesla Convertible Notes . Moreover subsidiary ZeroCoupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 Subsidiary Convertible Notes convertible share common stock conversion price 300.00 per share . Finally holder Tesla Convertible Notes Subsidiary Convertible Notes right require u repurchase note upon occurrence fundamental change purchase price equal 100 principal amount note plus accrued unpaid interest including fundamental change purchase date . 29 Our ability make scheduled payment principal interest indebtedness due make payment upon conversion repurchase demand respect convertible note refinance indebtedness may need desire depends future performance subject economic financial competitive factor beyond control . Our business may continue generate cash flow operation future sufficient satisfy obligation existing indebtedness future indebtedness may incur make necessary capital expenditure . If unable generate cash flow may required adopt one alternative reducing delaying investment capital expenditure selling asset refinancing obtaining additional equity capital term may onerous highly dilutive . Our ability refinance existing future indebtedness depend capital market financial condition time . In addition ability make payment may limited law regulatory authority agreement governing future indebtedness . We may able engage activity engage activity desirable term could result default existing future indebtedness material adverse effect business result operation financial condition . Our debt agreement contain covenant restriction may limit ability operate business . The term certain credit facility including Credit Agreement contain future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction limit ability operate business including restriction ability among thing incur additional debt issue guarantee create lien repurchase stock make restricted payment make certain voluntary prepayment specified debt . In addition certain circumstance required comply fixed charge coverage ratio . As result covenant ability respond change business economic condition engage beneficial transaction including obtain additional financing needed may restricted . Furthermore failure comply debt covenant could result default debt agreement could permit holder accelerate obligation repay debt . If debt accelerated may sufficient fund available repay . We may need want raise additional fund fund may available u need . If raise additional fund need want operation prospect could negatively affected . The design manufacture sale installation andor servicing automobile energy storage product solar product capitalintensive business specific timing cash inflow outflow may fluctuate substantially period period . Until consistently generating positive free cash flow may need want raise additional fund issuance equity equityrelated debt security obtaining credit financial institution fund together principal source liquidity cost developing manufacturing current future vehicle energy storage product andor solar product pay significant unplanned accelerated expense new significant strategic investment refinance significant consolidated indebtedness even required term indebtedness . We need sufficient capital fund ongoing operation research development project new product establishment andor increase Model 3 Model Y production capacity Fremont Factory Gigafactory Shanghai continued expansion Gigafactory Nevada construction Gigafactory Berlin manufacturing ramp Solar Roof Gigafactory New York continued expansion retail service location body shop Mobile Service fleet Supercharger network . We certain additional fund available u favorable term required . If raise additional fund need financial condition result operation business prospect could materially adversely affected . 30 We could subject liability penalty restrictive sanction adverse consequence arising certain governmental investigation proceeding . We cooperating certain government investigation discussed Note 16 Commitments Contingencies consolidated financial statement included elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . To knowledge government agency ongoing investigation concluded wrongdoing occurred . However predict outcome impact ongoing matter exists possibility could subject liability penalty restrictive sanction adverse consequence SEC DOJ government agency pursue legal action future . Moreover expect incur cost responding related request information subpoena instituted defending governmental proceeding . For example October 16 2018 U.S. District Court Southern District New York entered final judgment approving term settlement filed Court September 29 2018 connection action taken SEC relating Mr. Musks statement August 7 2018 considering taking Tesla private . Pursuant settlement among thing paid civil penalty 20 million appointed independent director Chair Board appointed two additional independent director board director made enhancement disclosure control corporate governancerelated matter . On April 26 2019 settlement amended clarify certain previouslyagreed disclosure procedure subsequently approved Court . All term prior settlement reaffirmed without modification . Although intend continue comply term requirement settlement lack compliance alleged lack compliance additional enforcement action legal proceeding may instituted u . If update discontinue use manufacturing equipment quickly expected may shorten useful life equipment retired result update resulting acceleration depreciation could negatively affect financial result . We invested expect continue invest significantly believe state art tooling machinery manufacturing equipment various product line depreciate cost equipment expected useful life . However manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly may decide update manufacturing process cuttingedge equipment quickly expected . Moreover continually implementing learning engineering manufacturing expertise efficiency increase may result ability manufacture product using le currently installed equipment . Alternatively ramp mature production product higher level learning may cause u discontinue use already installed equipment favor different additional equipment . The useful life equipment would retired early result would shortened causing depreciation equipment accelerated result operation could negatively impacted . We exposed fluctuation currency exchange rate could negatively affect financial result . We transact business globally multiple currency foreign currency risk related revenue cost revenue operating expense denominated currency U.S. dollar primarily euro Japanese yen Canadian dollar Chinese yuan Norwegian krone . To extent significant revenue denominated foreign currency strengthening U.S. dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar historically experienced . In addition portion cost expense anticipate continue denominated foreign currency including Japanese yen . If fully offsetting revenue currency value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . Moreover undertake limited hedging activity intended offset impact currency translation exposure impossible predict eliminate impact . As result operating result could adversely affected . 31 We may face regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle directly could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . We sell vehicle directly consumer using mean believe maximize reach currently including website store . While intend continue leverage effective sale strategy may able sell vehicle store state U.S. state law may interpreted impose limitation directtoconsumer sale model . In state also opened gallery educate inform customer product location actually transact sale vehicle . The application state law operation continues difficult predict . Laws state limited ability obtain dealer license state motor vehicle regulator may continue . In addition decision regulator permitting u sell vehicle may challenged dealer association others whether decision comply applicable state motor vehicle industry law . We prevailed many lawsuit result reinforced continuing belief state law designed prevent distribution model . In state also regulatory legislative effort dealer association propose law enacted would prevent u obtaining dealer license state given current sale model . A state passed legislation clarifies ability operate time limit number dealer license obtain store operate .
