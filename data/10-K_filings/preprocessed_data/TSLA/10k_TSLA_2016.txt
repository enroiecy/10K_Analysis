If unable continue reduce manufacturing cost Model S Model X control manufacturing cost Model 3 financial condition operating result suffer . As gradually ramped production Model S Model X manufacturing cost per vehicle decreased . While expect ongoing cost reduction realized u supplier guarantee able achieve sufficient cost saving reach gross margin profitability goal . We incur significant cost related procuring material required manufacture vehicle assembling vehicle compensating personnel . We may also incur substantial cost cost overrun increasing production capability vehicle manufacturing facility Model 3 . Furthermore unable achieve production cost target Model X Model 3 vehicle pursuant plan may able meet gross margin financial target . Furthermore many factor impact manufacturing cost beyond control potential increase cost material component lithiumion battery cell aluminum used produce body panel . If unable continue control reduce manufacturing cost operating result business prospect harmed . We significantly dependent upon revenue generated sale limited fleet electric vehicle currently includes Model S Model X also include Model 3 near term . We currently generate significant percentage revenue sale two product Model S Model X vehicle . Model 3 planning achieve volume production delivery second half 2017 requires significant investment prior commercial introduction guarantee commercially successful .

In particular fully qualified one supplier cell used battery pack current production vehicle . Any disruption supply battery cell supplier could disrupt production vehicle battery pack produce automobile manufacturer time different supplier fully qualified . Furthermore fluctuation shortage petroleum economic condition may cause u experience significant increase freight charge material cost . Substantial increase price material price charged u charged battery cell supplier would increase operating cost could reduce margin recoup increased cost increased vehicle price . Any attempt increase vehicle price response increased material cost could result cancellation vehicle order reservation therefore materially adversely affect brand image business prospect operating result . 18 We may become subject product liability claim could harm financial condition liquidity able successfully defend insure claim . Product liability claim could harm business prospect operating result financial condition . The automobile industry particular experience significant product liability claim face inherent risk exposure claim event vehicle perform expected resulting personal injury death . We also may face similar claim related misuse failure new technology pioneering including autopilot vehicle . Finally energy storage product solar energy system generate store electricity potential cause injury people property . A successful product liability claim u could require u pay substantial monetary award . Our risk area particularly pronounced given limited number vehicle energy storage product delivered date limited field experience product . Moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity product business could material adverse effect brand business prospect operating result . In jurisdiction generally selfinsure risk product liability claim meaning product liability claim likely paid company fund insurance . The market operate highly competitive may successful competing industry . We currently face competition new established domestic international competitor expect face competition others future including competition company new technology . The worldwide automotive market particularly alternative fuel vehicle highly competitive today expect become even future . There assurance vehicle successful respective market compete . Many established new automobile manufacturer BMW Daimler General Motors Toyota well company entered reported plan enter alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid fully electric vehicle . Most current potential competitor significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing resource may able devote greater resource design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale support product . Virtually competitor extensive customer base broader customer industry relationship almost company longer operating history greater name recognition . Increased competition could result lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss customer loss market share could harm business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition upon launch Model 3 vehicle face competition existing future automobile manufacturer extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan market including Audi BMW Lexus Mercedes . The solar renewable energy industry highly competitive within market also compete large utility . Decreases retail price electricity utility renewable energy source could harm ability offer competitive pricing lead increased rate customer default existing contract . Moreover solar panel price declined continuing decline . As increase solar panel manufacturing including Gigafactory 2 future price decline may harm ability compete produce solar panel competitive price . If unable establish maintain confidence longterm business prospect among consumer analyst within industry financial condition operating result business prospect stock price may suffer materially . Consumers may le likely purchase product convinced business succeed service support operation continue many year . Similarly supplier third party le likely invest time resource developing business relationship u convinced business succeed . Accordingly order build maintain business must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst party liquidity longterm business prospect . Maintaining confidence may particularly complicated certain factor limited operating history unfamiliarity product competition uncertainty regarding future electric vehicle product service quarterly production sale performance compared market expectation . Many factor largely outside control negative perception longterm business prospect even exaggerated unfounded would likely harm business make difficult raise additional fund needed . 19 Our plan expand network Tesla store gallery service center Superchargers require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale installation product availability Superchargers . Our plan expand network Tesla store gallery service center Superchargers require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale installation product . This ongoing global expansion includes planned entry market limited experience selling delivering installing andor servicing product may pose legal regulatory cultural political challenge previously encountered may desired effect increasing sale installation expanding brand presence degree anticipating . Furthermore increasing number Model S Model X vehicle well significant increase vehicle fleet size expect Model 3 require u continue increase number Supercharger station significantly . If fail customer could become dissatisfied could adversely affect sale vehicle . We also need ensure compliance regulatory requirement applicable sale installation service product sale electricity generated solar energy system operation Superchargers jurisdiction could take considerable time expense . If experience delay meet customer expectation expanding network Tesla store gallery service center Superchargers could lead decrease sale installation product could negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We face risk associated international operation expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax labor condition establishing new market could harm business . We currently international operation subsidiary various country jurisdiction subject legal political regulatory requirement social economic condition may different affecting u domestically . Additionally part growth strategy continue expand sale service Supercharger location internationally . International expansion requires u make significant expenditure including establishment local operating entity hiring local employee establishing facility advance generating revenue . We subject number risk associated international business activity may increase cost impact ability sell product require significant management attention . These risk include conforming product various international regulatory safety requirement well charging electric infrastructure difficulty establishing staffing managing foreign operation challenge attracting customer foreign government tax regulation permit requirement ability enforce contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff price exchange control preference foreign nation domestically manufactured product . If fail effectively grow manage residual financing credit risk related vehicle financing program business may suffer . We offer vehicle financing arrangement local subsidiary United States Canada Germany UK including leasing directly certain subsidiary . The profitability leasing program depends ability accurately project residual value secure adequate financing andor business partner fund grow program screen manage customer credit risk . We expect need leasing financing option significantly higher volume expect vehicle future especially Model 3 also expect higher proportion uptake program Model S Model X . If unable adequately fund leasing program internal fund partner external financing source compelling alternative financing program available customer may unable grow sale . Furthermore leasing business grows substantially business may suffer effectively manage greater level residual credit risk resulting growth . Finally successfully monitor comply applicable national state andor local financial regulation consumer protection law governing lease transaction may become subject enforcement action penalty either may harm business . Our resale value guarantee leasing program vehicle expose u risk resale value vehicle returned u lower estimate may result lower revenue gross margin profitability liquidity . We provided resale value guarantee many customer customer may sell vehicle back u certain point time predetermined resale value . Customers lease vehicle leasing partner u directly captive finance company . The resale value vehicle resold returned u pursuant program may lower estimate based limited secondary market vehicle . If incorrectly estimate residual value vehicle volume vehicle returned u higher estimate andor able resell timely profitability andor liquidity could negatively impacted . In case customer retain vehicle past guarantee period gross margin negatively impacted remaining revenue cost related vehicle recognized gross profit . 20 We apply lease accounting sale vehicle resale value guarantee lease made directly u leasing partner . Under lease accounting recognize associated revenue cost vehicle sale time rather fully upfront vehicle delivery . As result program generate lower revenue period car delivered higher gross margin period resale value guarantee compared purchase resale value guarantee apply . A higher anticipated prevalence program could therefore adverse impact near term revenue operating result . Moreover unlike sale vehicle resale value guarantee program leasing partner impact cash flow liquidity time vehicle delivery lease held directly u may receive small portion total vehicle purchase price time lease followed stream payment term lease . To extent expand leasing program without securing external financing business partner support expansion cash flow liquidity could also negatively impacted . The unavailability reduction elimination unfavorable determination respect government economic incentive United States abroad supporting development adoption electric vehicle solar energy could impact demand product service . We currently benefit certain government economic incentive supporting development adoption electric vehicle . In United States abroad incentive include among thing tax credit rebate encourage purchase electric vehicle . In Norway example purchase electric vehicle currently subject import tax tax nonrecurring vehicle fee 25 value added tax purchase tax apply purchase gaspowered vehicle . Notably quantum incentive program promoting electric vehicle tiny fraction amount incentive provided gaspowered vehicle oil gas industry . Nevertheless even limited benefit program could reduced eliminated exhausted . For example January 1 2016 previously available incentive Denmark favored purchase electric vehicle expired replaced newly phasedin incentive le generous incentive replaced . Moreover current regulation 7500 federal tax credit available United States purchase qualified electric vehicle least 17 kWh battery capacity vehicle begin phase respect vehicle delivered second calendar quarter following quarter deliver 200000th qualifying vehicle United States . In addition California implemented regulation phasing 2500 cash rebate qualified electric vehicle highincome consumer became effective March 2016 . In certain circumstance pressure oil gas lobby related special interest bring development could negative impact demand vehicle . In addition certain governmental rebate tax credit financial incentive currently available respect solar energy storage product business allow u lower installation cost cost capital encourage investor invest solar financing fund . However incentive may expire particular date end allocated funding exhausted reduced terminated solar energy adoption rate increase often without warning . For example federal government currently offer 30 investment tax credit ITC installation solar power facility installed concurrently energy storage system currently scheduled decline 10 expire altogether residential system January 2022 . Likewise jurisdiction net energy metering currently available customer receive bill credit utility energy solar energy system generate export grid excess electric load use . Several jurisdiction reduced eliminated benefit available net energy metering proposed . Such reduction termination governmental incentive could adversely impact result operation increasing cost capital making u le competitive potential customer adversely impact ability attract investment partner form new financing fund solar asset . Moreover fund investor claim ITC amount based fair market value solar energy system . Although obtain independent appraisal support claimed fair market value relevant governmental authority audited value certain case determined lower may future . Such determination may result adverse tax consequence andor obligation make indemnification payment contribute additional asset fund fund investor . If unable integrate SolarCity successfully business may realize anticipated benefit acquisition SolarCity . We devoted date continue devote substantial attention resource integrating company business operation SolarCity acquired November 2016 . Our company prior experience integrating business size scale SolarCity . If integration process take longer expected costly expected may fail realize anticipated benefit acquisition . 21 Potential difficulty may encounter integration process include following inability successfully combine business SolarCity manner permit combined company achieve synergy expect acquisition would result anticipated benefit acquisition realized partly wholly time frame currently anticipated complexity associated managing combined business integrating personnel two company creation uniform standard control procedure policy information system potential unknown liability unforeseen increased expense delay regulatory condition associated acquisition . Any failure u realize expected benefit substantial investment commitment respect manufacture PV cell including unable comply term agreement Research Foundation State University New York relating Gigafactory 2 could result negative consequence business . As part acquisition SolarCity acquired certain PV cell manufacturing technology asset buildtosuit lease arrangement Research Foundation State University New York Foundation . This agreement Foundation provides construction Gigafactory 2 Buffalo New York full capacity expect capable producing 1 gigawatt PV cell including solar roof . Under agreement obligated among thing employ specified minimum number personnel State New York 10year period following arrival manufacturing equipment receipt certain permit specified item Gigafactory 2 spend incur approximately 5 billion combined capital operational expense cost good sold cost State New York 10year period following achievement full production output Gigafactory 2 . If fail year course term agreement meet obligation would obligated pay program payment 41.2 million Foundation year . Any inability part comply requirement agreement may result payment significant amount Foundation termination lease Gigafactory 2 andor need secure alternative supply PV cell product solar roof . Moreover unable utilize manufacturing technology asset acquired SolarCity acquisition accordance expectation may recognize accounting charge pertaining writeoff asset . Any foregoing event could material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . We exposed fluctuation currency exchange rate could negatively affect financial result . Our revenue cost denominated foreign currency completely matched . As increased Model S delivery market outside United States much higher revenue cost denominated currency euro Chinese yuan Norwegian krone British pound Canadian dollar . Any strengthening U.S. dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar historically experienced . In addition portion cost expense anticipate continue denominated foreign currency including Japanese yen . If fully offsetting revenue currency value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . Moreover undertake limited hedging activity intended offset impact currency translation exposure impossible predict eliminate impact . As result operating result could adversely affected . If unable attract andor retain key employee hire qualified personnel ability compete could harmed . The loss service key employee could disrupt operation delay development introduction vehicle service negatively impact business prospect operating result . In particular highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technical Officer . None key employee bound employment agreement specific term may able successfully attract retain senior leadership necessary grow business . Our future success depends upon ability attract retain executive officer key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing support personnel failure could adversely impact business prospect financial condition operating result . 22 Key talent may leave Tesla due various factor competitive labor market talented individual automotive experience . Currently California increasing competition talented individual specialized knowledge electric vehicle software engineer manufacturing engineer skilled employee . This competition affect ability retain key employee hire new one . Our continued success depends upon continued ability hire new employee timely manner especially support expansion plan ramp highvolume manufacture vehicle retain current employee . Additionally compete mature prosperous company far greater financial resource startup emerging company promise shortterm growth opportunity . Difficulties retaining current employee recruiting new one could adverse effect performance . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer . We highly dependent service Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer Chairman Board Directors largest stockholder . Although Mr. Musk spends significant time Tesla highly active management devote full time attention Tesla . Among commitment Mr. Musk also currently serf Chief Executive Officer Chief Technical Officer Space Exploration Technologies developer manufacturer space launch vehicle . We subject various environmental safety law regulation could impose substantial cost upon u negatively impact ability operate manufacturing facility . As manufacturing company including respect facility Tesla Factory Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory 2 subject complex environmental health safety law regulation numerous jurisdictional level United States abroad including law relating use handling storage disposal human exposure hazardous material . The cost compliance including remediating contamination found property change operation mandated new amended law may significant .

Such cost delay may adversely impact business prospect operating result . Furthermore violation law may result substantial fine penalty remediation cost third party damage suspension cessation operation . Our business may adversely affected disruption caused union activity . It common employee company significant manufacturing operation u belong union result higher employee cost increased risk work stoppage . Moreover regulation jurisdiction outside United States mandate employee participation industrial collective bargaining agreement work council certain consultation right respect relevant company operation . Although work diligently provide best possible work environment employee may still decide join seek recognition form labor union may required become union signatory . Furthermore directly indirectly dependent upon company unionized work force part supplier trucking freight company work stoppage strike organized union could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result . If work stoppage occurs could delay manufacture sale product material adverse effect business prospect operating result financial condition . Our product service subject substantial regulation evolving unfavorable change failure u comply regulation could substantially harm business operating result . Motor vehicle subject substantial regulation international federal state local law . We incur significant cost complying regulation may required incur additional cost comply change regulation . We subject law regulation applicable import sale service automobile internationally . For example country outside United States required meet vehiclespecific safety standard often materially different requirement United States thus resulting additional investment vehicle system ensure regulatory compliance country . This process may include official review certification vehicle foreign regulatory agency prior market entry well compliance foreign reporting recall management system requirement . Additionally vehicle equipped range autopilot feature assist driver relieving certain tedious potentially dangerous aspect road travel . Autopilot recentlyintroduced feature domestic foreign regulator limited experience . Any current future proposed regulation area passed could impact whether customer able use vehicle equipped autopilot depending severity regulation could adversely affect business . 23 Moreover provider electricity generated solar energy system install customer impacted federal state local regulation policy concerning electricity pricing interconnection customergenerated electricity electric grid sale electricity generated thirdparty owned system . For example existing proposed regulation policy would permit utility limit amount electricity generated customer solar energy system charge fee penalty customer relating purchase energy grid adjust electricity rate design price solar product may competitive electricity grid restrict u customer transacting power purchase agreement qualifying government incentive benefit apply solar power limit eliminate net energy metering . If regulation policy remain effect adopted jurisdiction regulation policy facilitate connection solar energy system grid modified eliminated could deter potential customer purchasing solar product threaten economics existing contract cause u cease solar energy system sale operation relevant jurisdiction could harm business prospect financial condition result operation . We subject various privacy consumer protection law . Our privacy policy posted website failure u vendor business partner comply federal state international privacy data protection security law regulation could result regulatory litigationrelated action u legal liability fine damage cost . We may also incur substantial expense cost connection maintaining compliance law particular data protection law EU currently state transition . Although take step protect security customer personal information may required expend significant resource comply data breach requirement third party improperly obtain use personal information customer otherwise experience data loss respect customer personal information . A major breach network security system could negative consequence business future prospect including possible fine penalty damage reduced customer demand vehicle harm reputation brand . We may compelled undertake product recall take action could adversely affect brand image financial performance . Any product recall future may result adverse publicity damage brand adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . For example initiated Model S recall November 2015 discovered single field unit front seat belt issue Model X recall April 2016 internal test revealed unintended movement third row seat collision . None past recall related electric powertrain . In future may various time voluntarily involuntarily initiate recall product electric vehicle powertrain component provide vehicle OEMs including system part sourced supplier prove defective noncompliant applicable law regulation federal motor vehicle safety standard .
