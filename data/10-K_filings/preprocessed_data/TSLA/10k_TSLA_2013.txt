RISK FACTORS You carefully consider risk described together information set forth report could materially affect business financial condition future result . The risk described risk facing company . Risks uncertainty currently known u currently deem immaterial also may materially adversely affect business financial condition operating result . Risks Related Our Business Industry We may unable sustain current level production delivery Model S increase production delivery line plan could harm business prospect . We began manufacturing delivering Model S June 2012 . We limited experience date high volume manufacturing electric vehicle recently reached full production Model S U.S. market recently begun production Model S European Asian market . Our ability rampup high volume Model S production depend upon number factor including supplier ability deliver quality part u timely manner ability use manufacturing process planned volume production maintaining desired quality level efficiently making design change ensure consistently high quality . The Model S new vehicle producing new employee using new equipment therefore production process still maturing . To produce vehicle meet quality standard requires u carefully analyze step production plan improve efficiency manufacturing process continue train employee . Our supplier also must produce new product sufficient quantity quality level meet demand . Certain supplier experienced delay meeting demand sought renegotiate term supply arrangement continue focus supplier capability constraint . Any disruption maintaining production level Model S could materially damage brand business prospect financial condition operating result . We recently increased Model S delivery rate United States match current anticipated Model S production capacity . We limited experience high volume delivery Model S vehicle . We gradually ramped production Model S intend continue increase production rate significantly next several quarter . Furthermore recently commenced delivery Europe delivered Model S vehicle outside North America Europe volume thus may face difficulty meeting delivery growth plan Asia right hand drive market later year may impact ability achieve worldwide delivery goal . If unable increase production rate increase weekly delivery rate match production rate Model S ramp delivery Europe Asia sustain high level weekly Model S delivery throughout year could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition Model S introduced number new manufacturing technology technique aluminum spot welding system widely adopted automotive industry Model S number new unique design feature 17 inch display screen newly designed retractable exterior door handle panoramic roof pose unique manufacturing challenge . Model S production 23 Table Contents delivery continue require significant resource may experience unexpected delay difficulty could harm ability maintain full manufacturing capacity Model S cause u miss planned production target could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Additionally sustaining high volume production manner avoids significant cost overrun including result factor beyond control problem supplier vendor may difficult . Our ability sustain grow volume production delivery Model S subject certain risk uncertainty including supplier able willing deliver component timely basis necessary quantity quality acceptable price produce Model S volume reach financial target able complete necessary adjustment vehicle design manufacturing process Model S timely manner meet production plan allows high quality vehicle able commence execute launch ramp Model S Asia pursuant current timeline able adequately respond timely manner problem may arise vehicle able schedule complete delivery planned higher volume production level equipment tooling purchased select able accurately manufacture vehicle within specified design tolerance suffer unexpected breakdown damage could negatively affect rate needed produce vehicle volume able comply environmental workplace safety custom similar regulation required operate manufacturing facility able maintain improve quality control transition higher level inhouse manufacturing process information technology system currently expanding improving upon effective manage high volume production . Finally detailed longterm testing quality reliability durability testing Model S ongoing negative result testing could cause production delivery delay cost increase lower quality Model S vehicle . We dependent supplier vast majority single source supplier inability supplier continue deliver refusal deliver necessary component vehicle timely manner price quality level volume acceptable u would material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Model S contains numerous purchased part source globally 300 direct supplier majority currently single source supplier component . While obtain component multiple source whenever possible similar automobile manufacturer majority component used vehicle purchased u single source . To date qualified alternative source single sourced component used vehicle maintain longterm agreement number supplier . While believe may able establish alternate supply relationship obtain engineer replacement component single source component may unable short term price cost favorable u . In particular believe able secure alternate 24 Table Contents source supply single sourced component relatively short time frame qualifying alternate supplier developing replacement certain highly customized component vehicle may time consuming costly may force u make additional modification vehicle design . This supply chain expose u multiple potential source delivery failure component shortage Model S well powertrain component sale activity . For example earthquake similar one occurred Japan March 2011 could negatively impact supply chain . We past experienced source disruption supply chain including relating slowerthananticipated ramp Model S production goal 2012 . We may experience additional delay future respect Model S future vehicle may produce . In addition written agreement place majority supplier may create uncertainty regarding certain supplier obligation u including limited regarding warranty product liability . Changes business condition war governmental change factor beyond control presently anticipate could also affect supplier ability deliver component u timely basis . Furthermore experience significantly increased demand need replace certain existing supplier assurance additional supply component part available required term favorable u supplier would allocate sufficient supply u order meet requirement fill order timely manner . In past replaced certain supplier failure provide component met quality control standard . The loss single limited source supplier disruption supply component supplier could lead delay vehicle delivery customer could hurt relationship customer also materially adversely affect financial condition operating result . Changes supply chain resulted past may result future increased cost delay . We also experienced cost increase certain supplier order meet quality target development timeline well due design change made may experience similar cost increase future . Additionally negotiating existing supplier cost reduction seeking new le expensive supplier certain part attempting redesign certain part make cheaper produce . If unsuccessful effort control reduce supplier cost operating result suffer . Additionally cost reduction effort may interrupt harm normal production process thereby harming Model S quality reducing Model S production output . Furthermore failure supplier provide component timely manner level quality necessary manufacture performance electric vehicle Model S could prevent u fulfilling customer order timely fashion could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . Finally October 2013 entered amendment existing supply agreement Panasonic Corporation order address anticipated short mediumterm lithium ion battery cell need . While expect supply agreement amended provide u sufficient cell next year may able meet longterm need including third generation electric vehicle refer Gen III program may introduce without securing additional supplier source cell . If secure additional supplier source could experience production delay could material adverse effect financial condition operating result . If unable adequately reduce manufacturing cost Model S otherwise control cost associated operating business financial condition operating result suffer . Our production cost Model S high initially due startup cost Tesla Factory manufacturing inefficiency including low absorption fixed manufacturing cost higher logistics cost due immaturity supply chain higher initial price component part initial period launch ramp Model S. As gradually ramped production Model S manufacturing cost per 25 Table Contents vehicle fallen . While expect cost reduction effort undertaken u supplier continue reduce cost next several quarter guarantee able achieve planned cost reduction various cost saving initiative failure achieve saving would negatively affect ability reach gross margin profitability goal . We incur significant cost related procuring raw material required manufacture highperformance electric car assembling vehicle compensating personnel . We may also incur substantial cost cost overrun increasing production capability Model S powertrain manufacturing facility planned launch Asia spring 2014 . Furthermore unable produce Model X pursuant plan due cost overrun unexpected cost may able meet gross margin target . Additionally future may required incur substantial marketing cost expense promote vehicle including use traditional medium television radio print even though marketing expense date relatively limited date relied upon unconventional marketing effort . If unable keep operating cost aligned level revenue generate operating result business prospect harmed . Furthermore many factor impact operating cost beyond control . For example cost raw material component lithiumion battery cell aluminum used produce body panel could increase due shortage global demand product increase . Indeed popularity electric vehicle exceeds current expectation without significant expansion battery cell production capacity advancement battery cell technology shortage could occur would result increased material cost u potentially limit ability expand production . Our longterm success dependent upon ability design build achieve market acceptance new vehicle model specifically Model S new vehicle model Model X Gen III U.S. abroad . Our longterm success dependent market acceptance Model S sedan future electric vehicle introduce . In United States guarantee Model S continue successfully accepted general public especially longterm . As expand Europe enter Asia guarantee customer market embrace vehicle demand vehicle could lower expectation . For example experienced greater initial success selling Model S vehicle Norway rest Europe . Moreover assurance able design future electric vehicle meet expectation customer future model including Model X crossover become commercially viable . To date publicly revealed early prototype Model X . To extent able build Model X expectation created early prototype announced specification customer may cancel reservation future sale could harmed investor may lose confidence u . In addition also announced intent develop Gen III expect produce Tesla Factory introduction Model X . We intend offer vehicle lower price point expect produce higher volume Model S. Importantly anticipate producing Gen III vehicle mass market thus need highvolume supply lithiumion cell reasonable price . While plan attempt produce lithiumion cell finished battery pack Gen III vehicle new Tesla Gigafactory plan production early stage yet selected site construction Tesla Gigafactory completed factory design . In addition experience production lithiumion cell accordingly intend engage partner significant experience cell production date formalized partnership . In addition cost building operating Tesla Gigafactory could exceed current expectation Tesla Gigafactory may take longer bring online anticipate . If unable build Tesla Gigafactory timely manner produce high volume quality lithiumion cell Gen III reasonable price thus forced rely others 26 Table Contents supply u lithiumion cell Gen III ability produce Gen III vehicle price allows u sell Gen III profitably could constrained . Finally limited experience allocating available resource among design production multiple model vehicle Model S including variant may introduce righthand drive Model X Gen III . While intend production vehicle variant meet distinct segment automotive market vehicle may end competing may delay sale associated revenue future period . Also fail accurately anticipate demand vehicle could result inefficient expenditure production delay . Furthermore historically automobile customer come expect new improved vehicle model introduced frequently . In order meet expectation may future required introduce regular basis new vehicle model well enhanced version existing vehicle model . As technology change future automobile general performance electric vehicle specifically expected upgrade adapt vehicle introduce new model order continue provide vehicle latest technology meet customer expectation . To date limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting selling electric vehicle . Our future growth dependent upon consumer willingness adopt electric vehicle . Our growth highly dependent upon adoption consumer subject elevated risk reduced demand alternative fuel vehicle general electric vehicle particular . If market electric vehicle U.S. Europe Asia develop expect develops slowly expect business prospect financial condition operating result harmed . The market alternative fuel vehicle relatively new rapidly evolving characterized rapidly changing technology price competition additional competitor evolving government regulation industry standard frequent new vehicle announcement changing consumer demand behavior . Other factor may influence adoption alternative fuel vehicle specifically electric vehicle include perception electric vehicle quality safety particular respect lithiumion battery pack design performance cost especially adverse event accident occur linked quality safety electric vehicle related Chevrolet Volt battery pack fire recent incident involving Model S perception vehicle safety general particular safety issue may attributed use advanced technology including vehicle electronics regenerative braking system negative perception electric vehicle expensive nonelectric vehicle affordable government subsidy limited range electric vehicle may driven single battery charge effect weather range decline electric vehicle range resulting deterioration time battery ability hold charge varied calculation driving range achievable EVs inherently difficult given numerous factor affecting battery range capability rapidly swap Model S battery pack plan develop specialized public facility perform swapping concern electric grid capacity reliability could derail past present effort promote electric vehicle practical solution vehicle require gasoline concern potential customer battery pack charged properly may become unusable may need replaced 27 Table Contents availability alternative fuel vehicle including plugin hybrid electric vehicle improvement fuel economy internal combustion engine availability service electric vehicle consumer desire ability purchase luxury automobile one perceived exclusive environmental consciousness consumer volatility cost oil gasoline consumer perception dependency United States oil unstable hostile country government regulation economic incentive promoting fuel efficiency alternate form energy well tax governmental incentive purchase operate electric vehicle access charging station standardization electric vehicle charging system consumer perception convenience cost charge electric vehicle perception actual cost alternative fuel . In addition report suggested potential extreme temperature affect range performance electric vehicle based internal testing estimate vehicle may experience material reduction range operated extremely cold temperature . To extent customer concern reduction third party report suggest reduction range greater estimate gain widespread acceptance ability market sell vehicle particularly colder climate may adversely impacted . Additionally become subject regulation require u alter design vehicle could negatively impact consumer interest vehicle . For example electric vehicle make le noise internal combustion vehicle . Due concern quiet vehicle vision impaired pedestrian January 2011 Congress passed President signed Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act 2010 . The new law requires NHTSA establish minimum sound electric vehicle hybrid electric vehicle travelling low speed . NHTSA issued notice proposed rulemaking 2013 plan finalize rule soon sometime 2014 effective date could implemented September 1 2015 . This begin three year phasein schedule establishing minimum sound electric hybrid electric vehicle . Adding artificial noise may cause current potential customer purchase electric vehicle would materially adversely affect business operating result financial condition prospect . If fail manage future growth effectively rapidly grow company especially internationally may able produce market sell service vehicle successfully . Any failure manage growth effectively could materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . We continue expand operation significantly U.S. well Europe Asia . Our future operating result depend large extent ability manage expansion growth successfully . Risks face undertaking global expansion include finding training new personnel especially new market Europe Asia controlling expense investment anticipation expanded operation establishing expanding sale service Supercharger facility timely manner adapting product meet local requirement country around world implementing enhancing manufacturing logistics administrative infrastructure system process . 28 Table Contents We intend continue hire significant number additional personnel including manufacturing personnel design personnel engineer service technician performance electric vehicle . Because highperformance vehicle based different technology platform traditional internal combustion engine may able hire individual sufficient training performance electric vehicle need expend significant time expense training employee hire . Competition individual experience designing manufacturing servicing electric vehicle intense may able attract assimilate train retain additional highly qualified personnel future failure could seriously harm business prospect operating result financial condition . Our limited experience product offering make evaluating business future prospect difficult . We formed July 2003 began delivering first vehicle Tesla Roadster early 2008 . We began producing second electric vehicle Model S June 2012 production process continue mature especially production process related Model S delivery Europe planned delivery Asia righthand drive Model S. Model S became primary contributor revenue starting fourth quarter 2012 . We intend longer term derive substantial revenue sale Model S Model X Gen III future electric vehicle . Further produced early prototype Model X crossover recently started production Model S Asia . Our vehicle design engineering manufacturing component supply plan Model S may continue adjusted . In addition powertrain component sale development service revenue powertrain research development compensation almost entirely generated arrangement Daimler AG Daimler Toyota Motor Corporation Toyota guarantee able enter future agreement company favorable term manufacture deliver powertrain component manner costeffective u . Finally difficult predict future revenue appropriately budget expense limited insight trend may emerge affect business . In event actual result differ estimate adjust estimate future period operating result financial position could materially affected . We may fail meet publicly announced guidance expectation business would cause stock price decline . We occasionally provide guidance regarding expected financial business performance projection regarding number vehicle hope sell produce future period anticipated future revenue gross margin profitability cash flow . Correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition predicting future event inherently uncertain process . Our guidance based part assumption include limited assumption regarding ability achieve anticipated production sale volume projected average sale price Model S U.S. Europe Asia supplier commodityrelated cost planned cost reduction . Such guidance may always accurate may vary actual result due inability meet assumption impact financial performance could occur result various risk uncertainty business set forth risk factor way applicable accounting rule require u treat new product service offering may offer . We offer assurance guidance ultimately accurate investor treat guidance appropriate caution . If fail meet guidance find necessary revise guidance even failure revision 29 Table Contents seemingly insignificant investor analyst may lose confidence u market value common stock could materially adversely affected . Our vehicle make use lithiumion battery cell observed catch fire vent smoke flame event raised concern future event may lead additional concern battery used automotive application . The battery pack Tesla Roadster Model S make use lithiumion cell . We also currently intend make use lithiumion cell battery pack sell Toyota Daimler well future vehicle may produce . On rare occasion lithiumion cell rapidly release energy contain venting smoke flame manner ignite nearby material well lithiumion cell . Extremely rare incident laptop computer cell phone electric vehicle battery pack catching fire focused consumer attention safety cell . These event raised concern battery used automotive application . To address question concern number cell manufacturer pursuing alternative lithiumion battery cell chemistry improve safety . We designed battery pack passively contain single cell release energy without spreading neighboring cell . However delivered limited number Tesla Roadsters Model S sedan customer limited field experience vehicle especially Model S. We also delivered limited number battery pack Toyota Daimler . Accordingly assurance field testing failure Model S battery pack produce occur could damage vehicle lead personal injury death may subject u lawsuit . We may recall vehicle participate recall vehicle contains battery pack redesign battery pack would time consuming expensive . Also negative public perception regarding suitability lithiumion cell automotive application future incident involving lithiumion cell vehicle fire even incident involve u could seriously harm business . In addition store significant number lithiumion cell manufacturing facility . Any mishandling battery cell may cause disruption operation facility . While implemented safety procedure related handling cell assurance safety issue fire related cell would disrupt operation .

We sure expanded system required functionality fully effectively implemented timely basis maintained . If successfully implement improve maintain system operation may disrupted operating result could harmed . In addition system functionality may operate expect may required expend significant resource correct problem find alternative source performing function . We may realize benefit Supercharger network could harm business brand operating result . We recently started deploy Tesla Superchargers United States Europe . Tesla Superchargers network charging station designed provide fastcharge capability owner Model S vehicle Supercharging option . We intend expand Tesla Supercharger network throughout U.S. Canada Europe Asia may unable due number factor including inability secure delay securing suitable location permit problem negotiating lease landowner obtaining required permit location difficulty interfacing infrastructure various utility company greater expected cost difficulty installing maintaining operating network . We may also unable expand Supercharger network fast intend public expects place charging station place customer believe optimal . Furthermore even Superchargers exist increasing number Model S vehicle may oversaturate available charging bay Superchargers leading increased wait time dissatisfaction customer . In addition announced charging customer access network addition already paid vehicle significant unexpected cost encounter entirely borne u may harm operating result . Although Supercharger network intended address customer concern regarding longdistance travel network may result increased reservation sale Model S 34 Table Contents future vehicle . If Supercharger network expanded currently planned quickly planned may realize benefit Supercharger network business operating result could materially affected . If unable design develop market sell new electric vehicle address additional market opportunity business prospect operating result suffer . We may able successfully develop new electric vehicle address new market segment develop significantly broader customer base . In 2012 publicly revealed early prototype Model X crossover first vehicle intend develop leveraging Model S platform . We also announced intent develop Gen III based smaller platform Model S expect produce Tesla Factory introduction Model X . The Gen III currently planned lower cost smaller sedan designed mass market . Therefore intend manufacture Gen III significantly higher volume Model S assurance successfully scale business accordingly . In addition yet finalized design engineering component sourcing plan Gen III assurance able bring vehicle market price point volume currently intend . The market vehicle price range expect Gen III much competitive Models S X therefore margin likely lower compared Model S margin . Our effort manufacture sell sufficiently profitable Gen III may successful therefore business prospect operating result may suffer . Our failure address additional market opportunity would harm business prospect financial condition operating result . We may experience significant delay design manufacture launch Model X could harm business prospect . We expect Model X prototype production design road end 2014 begin volume delivery customer spring 2015 . Any significant delay design manufacture launch Model X could materially damage brand business prospect financial condition operating result . Automobile manufacturer often experience delay design manufacture commercial release new vehicle model . We experienced significant delay launching Tesla Roadster resulted additional cost adverse publicity business . In 2012 also experienced delay ramp Model S. We may experience delay launching Model X may result cost overrun adverse publicity . We design development stage Model X . Furthermore yet evaluated qualified selected supplier planned production Model X . We may able engage supplier component timely manner acceptable price necessary quantity . We also need extensive testing ensure Model X compliance applicable NHTSA safety regulation obtain EPA CARB certification emission regulation prior beginning volume production delivery vehicle . In addition limited resource extent engineering manufacturing resource devoted Model S otherwise engaged development service activity may difficulty designing delivering Model X timely manner . If able manufacture deliver Model X timely manner consistent production timeline budget cost projection business prospect operating result financial condition negatively impacted ability grow business harmed . The automotive market highly competitive may successful competing industry . We currently face competition new established competitor expect face competition others future . The worldwide automotive market particularly alternative fuel vehicle highly competitive today expect become even future . Other automobile manufacturer entered electric vehicle market end 2010 expect additional competitor enter market . With respect Model S face competition existing future automobile manufacturer extremely competitive premium sedan market including Audi BMW Lexus Mercedes . 35 Table Contents Many established new automobile manufacturer entered announced plan enter alternative fuel vehicle market . Mitsubishi selling fully electric iMiEV Japan since April 2010 Nissan selling fully electric Nissan Leaf since December 2010 . In past year Ford introduced fully electric Ford Focus Renault introduced fully electric Renault Fluence Fiat introduced Fiat 500e among others .

Finally electric vehicle already brought market China foreign country expect number manufacturer enter United States market well . Most current potential competitor significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing resource may able devote greater resource design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale support product . Virtually competitor extensive customer base broader customer industry relationship . In addition almost company longer operating history greater name recognition . Our competitor may stronger position respond quickly new technology may able design develop market sell product effectively . Additionally past currently offer customary discount vehicle like competitor . We expect competition industry intensify future light increased demand alternative fuel vehicle continuing globalization consolidation worldwide automotive industry . Factors affecting competition include product quality feature innovation development time pricing reliability safety fuel economy customer service financing term . Increased competition may lead lower vehicle unit sale increased inventory may result downward price pressure adversely affect business financial condition operating result prospect . Our ability successfully compete industry fundamental future success existing new market market share . There assurance able compete successfully market . If competitor introduce new car service compete surpass quality price performance car service may unable satisfy existing customer attract new customer price level would allow u generate attractive rate return investment . Increased competition could result price reduction revenue shortfall loss customer loss market share could harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Demand automobile industry highly volatile may lead lower vehicle unit sale adversely affect operating result . Volatility demand automobile industry may materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . The market currently compete plan compete future subject considerable volatility demand recent period . For example according automotive industry source sale passenger vehicle North America fourth quarter 2008 30 lower period prior year . Demand automobile sale depends large extent general economic political social condition given market introduction new vehicle technology . As new automobile manufacturer low volume producer le financial resource established automobile manufacturer withstand change market disruption demand . As business grows economic condition trend country region currently sell 36 Table Contents electric vehicle Europe Asia impact business prospect operating result well . Demand electric vehicle may also affected factor directly impacting automobile price cost purchasing operating automobile sale financing incentive price raw material part component cost fuel governmental regulation including tariff import regulation tax . Volatility demand may lead lower vehicle unit sale increased inventory may result downward price pressure adversely affect business prospect financial condition operating result . These effect may pronounced impact business given relatively smaller scale financial resource compared many incumbent automobile manufacturer . Our financial result may vary significantly periodtoperiod due seasonality business fluctuation operating cost factor . Our operating result may vary significantly periodtoperiod due many factor including seasonal factor may effect demand electric vehicle . Demand new car automobile industry typically decline winter season sale generally higher spring summer month . Sales Tesla Roadster fluctuated seasonal basis increased sale spring summer month second third fiscal quarter relative fourth first fiscal quarter . We note general automotive sale tend decline winter season anticipate sale Model S future model may similar seasonality . However limited operating history make difficult u judge exact nature extent seasonality business . Also unusually severe weather condition market may impact demand vehicle . Our operating result could also suffer achieve revenue consistent expectation seasonal demand many expense based anticipated level annual revenue . In addition expect periodtoperiod operating result vary based operating cost anticipate increase significantly future period among thing design develop manufacture Model X future product increase production capacity manufacturing facility produce vehicle higher volume develop Tesla Gigafactory open new Tesla service center maintenance repair capability open new Supercharger location increase sale marketing activity increase general administrative function support growing operation . As result factor believe quartertoquarter comparison operating result especially shortterm necessarily meaningful comparison relied upon indicator future performance . Moreover operating result may meet expectation equity research analyst investor . If occurs trading price common stock could fall substantially either suddenly time . If unable establish maintain confidence longterm business prospect among consumer analyst within industry financial condition operating result business prospect stock price may suffer materially . Our vehicle highly technical product require maintenance support . If cease cut back operation even year buyer vehicle year earlier might much difficulty maintaining vehicle obtaining satisfactory support . As result consumer may le likely purchase vehicle convinced business succeed operation continue many year . Similarly supplier third party le likely invest time resource developing business relationship u convinced business succeed . If required curtail expansion plan future done past may result negative perception regarding longterm business prospect may lead cancellation Model S Model X order reservation . Accordingly order build maintain business must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst party liquidity longterm business prospect . In contrast 37 Table Contents established automaker believe case task maintaining confidence may particularly complicated factor following limited operating history unfamiliarity uncertainty Model X uncertainty longterm marketplace acceptance alternative fuel vehicle generally electric vehicle specifically perceived prospect need ongoing infusion external capital fund planned operation size expansion plan comparison existing capital base scope history operation prospect actual emergence direct sustained competitive pressure established automaker may likely initial effort perceived commercially successful . Many factor largely outside control negative perception longterm business prospect even exaggerated unfounded would likely harm business make difficult raise additional fund needed . We may need want raise additional fund fund may available u need . If raise additional fund need want operation prospect could negatively affected . The design manufacture sale servicing automobile capital intensive business . We expect principal source liquidity provide u adequate liquidity based current plan . However consistently generating positive free cash flow cost developing manufacturing Model X exceed expectation incur significant unplanned expense embark accelerate new significant strategic investment Tesla Gigafactory may need raise additional fund issuance equity equityrelated debt security obtaining credit government financial institution . This capital necessary fund ongoing operation continue research development project including planned Model X crossover Gen III vehicle establish sale service center build deploy Superchargers make investment tooling manufacturing capital required introduce Model X . We certain additional fund available u favorable term required . If raise additional fund need financial condition result operation business prospect could materially adversely affected . We limited experience servicing vehicle using different service model one typically used industry . If unable address service requirement existing future customer business materially adversely affected . If unable successfully address service requirement existing future customer meet customer expectation regarding service business prospect materially adversely affected . We limited experience servicing vehicle . Servicing electric vehicle different servicing vehicle internal combustion engine requires specialized skill including high voltage training servicing technique . If unable satisfactorily service customer various service related issue facing may face future ability generate customer loyalty grow business sell additional Model S vehicle could impaired . We service performance electric vehicle companyowned Tesla service center certain store mobile service technician known Tesla Rangers . However certain service center open short period date limited experience servicing performance vehicle location . We need open new standalone service center hire train significant number new 38 Table Contents employee staff service center act Tesla Rangers order successfully maintain fleet delivered performance electric vehicle . We implemented Tesla Rangers program October 2009 limited experience deploying service customer vehicle . There assurance service arrangement limited experience servicing vehicle adequately address service requirement customer satisfaction sufficient resource meet service requirement timely manner volume vehicle able deliver annually increase . We expect able open Tesla service center geographic area existing potential customer may reside . In order address service need customer geographical proximity service center plan either transport vehicle nearest Tesla store service center servicing deploy mobile Tesla Rangers service vehicle customer location . These special arrangement may expensive may able recoup cost providing service customer . In addition number potential customer may choose purchase vehicle lack widespread service network . If adequately address customer service need brand reputation adversely affected turn could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . Traditional automobile manufacturer United States provide maintenance repair service directly . Consumers must rather service vehicle franchised dealership third party maintenance service provider . We arrangement third party service provider unclear even whether third party service provider able acquire expertise service vehicle . At point anticipate providing substantially service vehicle foreseeable future . As vehicle placed location may encounter negative reaction consumer frustrated use local service station extent conventional automobile frustration may result negative publicity reduced sale thereby harming business prospect . In addition motor vehicle industry law many state require service facility available respect vehicle physically sold location state . Whether law would also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet consumer state physical presence uncertain . While believe Tesla Ranger program practice shipping customer vehicle nearest Tesla store service would satisfy regulator circumstance without seeking formal regulatory guidance assurance regulator attempt require provide physical service facility state . Further certain state franchise law prohibit manufacturer licensed dealer acting capacity dealer also restrict manufacturer providing vehicle service . If issue arise connection law certain aspect Teslas service program would need restructured comply state law may harm business . We may succeed maintaining strengthening Tesla brand would materially adversely affect customer acceptance vehicle component business revenue prospect . Our business prospect heavily dependent ability develop maintain strengthen Tesla brand . Any failure develop maintain strengthen brand may materially adversely affect ability sell Model S Model X Gen III future planned electric vehicle sell electric powertrain component . If continue establish maintain strengthen brand may lose opportunity build critical mass customer . Promoting positioning brand likely depend significantly ability provide high quality electric car maintenance repair service limited experience area . Any problem associated Toyota RAV4 EV us Tesla powertrain MercedesBenz BClass EV use Tesla powertrain Model X may hurt Tesla brand . 39 Table Contents In addition expect ability develop maintain strengthen Tesla brand also depend heavily success marketing effort . To date limited experience marketing activity relied primarily internet word mouth attendance industry trade show promote brand . To promote brand may required change marketing practice could result substantially increased advertising expense including need use traditional medium television radio print . The automobile industry intensely competitive may successful building maintaining strengthening brand . Many current potential competitor particularly automobile manufacturer headquartered Detroit Japan European Union greater name recognition broader customer relationship substantially greater marketing resource . If develop maintain strong brand business prospect financial condition operating result materially adversely impacted . If vehicle owner customize vehicle change charging infrastructure aftermarket product vehicle may operate properly could harm business . Automobile enthusiast may seek hack vehicle modify performance could compromise vehicle safety system . Also aware customer customized vehicle aftermarket part may compromise driver safety . For example customer installed seat elevate driver airbag safety system could compromised . Other customer changed wheel tire others installed large speaker system may impact electrical system vehicle . We tested endorse change product . In addition customer use improper external cabling unsafe charging outlet expose customer injury high voltage electricity . Such unauthorized modification could reduce safety vehicle injury resulting modification could result adverse publicity would negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Our deposit Model S reservation Model X may refundable customer significant cancellation could harm financial condition business prospect . As December 31 2013 163.2 million customer deposit primarily Model S Model X . Model S deposit generally subject cancellation customer fully refundable two week placing order . Model X reservation fully refundable time customer begin configure vehicle delivery . We experienced order cancellation vehicle refund related deposit cancellation may continue . Given lead time historically experienced customer reservation delivery Tesla Roadster Model S expect experience Model X risk customer placed order made reservation vehicle may cancel order reservation ultimately take delivery vehicle due potential change customer preference competitive development factor . Additionally encounter delay planned launch ramp Asia delay introduction Model X significant number customer could similarly cancel order reservation demand refund deposit . As result assurance made order reservation cancelled ultimately result final purchase delivery sale vehicle . Our plan expand network Tesla store service center Superchargers require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale electric vehicle . In addition may able open store service center certain state Superchargers desired location .

This ongoing global expansion may desired effect increasing sale expanding brand presence degree anticipating . Furthermore assurance able expand budget timeline established . We also need ensure compliance regulatory requirement applicable sale service vehicle jurisdiction could take considerable time expense . If experience delay expanding network Tesla store service center Superchargers could lead decrease sale vehicle could negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We opened Tesla store service center major metropolitan area throughout North America Europe Asia plan open additional store service center worldwide support ongoing worldwide Model S rollout . We also rapidly expanded Supercharger network U.S .and Europe . However may able expand sufficient rate planned expansion require significant cash investment management resource well efficiency execution establishing location hiring training necessary employee effectively sell service vehicle . Furthermore certain state foreign jurisdiction may permit requirement franchise dealer law similar law regulation may preclude restrict ability open store sell vehicle state jurisdiction . Any prohibition restriction may lead decreased sale jurisdiction could harm business prospect operating result . See Risk Factor We may face regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle directly internet could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . Additionally may face potential difficulty finding suitable Supercharger site desired location negotiating lease obtaining required permit location . We face risk associated international operation including unfavorable regulatory political tax labor condition establishing new market could harm business . We face various risk associated international operation . We currently international operation subsidiary various country jurisdiction Europe Asia subject legal political regulatory social requirement economic condition jurisdiction . Additionally part growth strategy continue expand sale maintenance repair Supercharger service internationally particularly China . However limited experience date selling servicing vehicle internationally expansion requires u make significant expenditure including establishment local operating entity hiring local employee establishing facility advance generating revenue . We subject number risk associated international business activity may increase cost impact ability sell electric vehicle require significant management attention . These risk include conforming vehicle various international regulatory safety requirement vehicle sold homologation difficulty establishing staffing managing foreign operation difficulty attracting customer new jurisdiction foreign government tax regulation permit requirement including foreign tax may able offset tax imposed upon u United States foreign tax law limiting ability repatriate fund United States fluctuation foreign currency exchange rate interest rate including risk related interest rate swap hedging activity undertake ability enforce contractual intellectual property right especially foreign country respect protect intellectual property right extent United States Japan European country increase risk unauthorized uncompensated use technology United States foreign government trade restriction custom regulation tariff price exchange control 41 Table Contents foreign labor law regulation restriction preference foreign nation domestically produced vehicle change diplomatic trade relationship political instability natural disaster war event terrorism strength international economy .

These type issue could also arise enter new market China . If customer experience problem way charging equipment work local charging infrastructure unable adapt equipment resolve problem viability acceptance vehicle market could materially adversely affected . If fail successfully address risk business prospect operating result financial condition could materially harmed . Foreign currency movement relative U.S. dollar could harm financial result . Our revenue cost denominated foreign currency completely matched . A portion cost expense anticipate continue denominated foreign currency including Japanese yen euro Chinese yuan British pound . If fully offsetting revenue currency value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency especially Japanese yen cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . As result operating result could adversely affected . As dramatically increase Model S delivery overseas 2014 beyond well begin delivering powertrain unit Daimler may greater revenue cost denominated currency case strengthening dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar . Developments alternative technology improvement internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect demand electric vehicle . Significant development alternative technology advanced diesel ethanol fuel cell compressed natural gas improvement fuel economy internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect business prospect way currently anticipate . Any failure u develop new enhanced technology process react change existing technology could materially delay development introduction new enhanced electric vehicle could result loss competitiveness vehicle decreased revenue loss market share competitor . The unavailability reduction elimination government economic incentive could material adverse effect business financial condition operating result prospect . Any reduction elimination discriminatory application government subsidy economic incentive policy change reduced need subsidy incentive due customer base electric vehicle fiscal tightening reason may result diminished competitiveness alternative fuel vehicle industry generally electric vehicle particular . This could materially adversely affect growth alternative fuel automobile market business prospect financial condition operating result . Our growth depends part availability amount government subsidy economic incentive alternative fuel vehicle generally performance electric vehicle specifically . For example 42 Table Contents currently benefit exemption California state sale use tax purchase 707 million manufacturing equipment arrangement California Alternative Energy Advanced Transportation Financing Authority . To extent equipment purchased would otherwise subject California state sale use tax believe incentive would result tax saving u December 2016 . This exemption available equipment would otherwise subject California sale use tax would used specified purpose . If fail meet condition would unable take full advantage tax incentive financial position could harmed . In addition certain regulation law encourage sale electric car tax credit subsidy could reduced eliminated applied way creates adverse effect vehicle either currently time future . For example federal state foreign government time time enacted tax credit incentive purchase alternative fuel car funding program limited guarantee vehicle eligible tax credit incentive provided alternative fuel vehicle future . This would put vehicle competitive disadvantage . As example state level California renewed Clean Vehicle Rebate Program rebate program purchase qualified alternative technology vehicle 2013 . Such fund however may run limited way would adverse purchaser vehicle . Subsequent purchaser could face delay receiving rebate since would wait next fiscal year funding became available unable obtain rebate . Moreover eligible EVs produced California need find additional source funding program implement option removing eligibility vehicle based MSRP customer income level . These measure would almost certainly impact u adverse manner making either vehicle customer ineligible rebate . As additional example considerable discussion federal level tax reform . Discussions included reducing even eliminating current 7500 tax credit available purchaser qualified alternative fuel vehicle including Model S. Also government program enacted Europe favoring purchase electric vehicle including disincentive discourage use gaspowered vehicle . In Norway example purchase electric vehicle currently subject import tax tax nonrecurring vehicle fee 25 value added tax purchase tax apply purchase gaspowered vehicle . In event government program reduced eliminated available benefit thereunder exhausted earlier anticipated sale electric vehicle including Model S could adversely affected . Our relationship Daimler subject various risk could adversely affect business future prospect . Our relationship Daimler pose various risk u including potential loss access part Daimler providing Model S potential loss business adverse publicity brand image defect problem discovered electric powertrain component Daimler incorporated vehicle . The occurrence foregoing could adversely affect business prospect financial condition operating result . The operation vehicle different internal combustion engine vehicle customer may experience difficulty operating properly including difficulty transitioning different method braking . We designed vehicle minimize inconvenience inadvertent driver damage powertrain . In certain instance protection may cause vehicle behave way unfamiliar driver internal combustion vehicle . For example employ regenerative braking recharge battery pack mode vehicle operation . Our customer may become accustomed using regenerative braking instead wheel brake slow vehicle . However vehicle maximum charge regenerative braking needed employed vehicle . Accordingly customer may difficulty shifting different method braking . In addition use safety mechanism limit motor torque 43 Table Contents powertrain system reach elevated temperature . In instance vehicle acceleration speed decrease . Finally driver permit battery pack substantially deplete charge vehicle progressively limit motor torque speed preserve charge remains . The vehicle lose speed ultimately coast stop . Despite several warning imminent loss charge ultimate loss speed may unexpected . There assurance customer operate vehicle properly especially situation . Any accident resulting failure operate vehicle properly could harm brand reputation result adverse publicity product liability claim material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition consumer dislike feature may choose buy additional car u could also harm business prospect . If unable keep advance electric vehicle technology may suffer decline competitive position . We may unable keep change electric vehicle technology result may suffer decline competitive position . Any failure keep advance electric vehicle technology would result decline competitive position would materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . Our research development effort may sufficient adapt change electric vehicle technology . As technology change plan upgrade adapt vehicle introduce new model order continue provide vehicle latest technology particular battery cell technology . However vehicle may compete effectively alternative vehicle able source integrate latest technology vehicle .
