Automobile Manufacturer Dealer Regulation State law regulates manufacture distribution sale automobile generally requires motor vehicle manufacturer dealer licensed . To extent possible plan secure dealer license equivalent dealer license engage activity motor vehicle dealer far permitted open additional Tesla store service center . Some state permit automobile manufacturer licensed dealer act capacity dealer . To sell vehicle resident state licensed dealer extent permitted local law actual sale would generally occur state . In scenario possible activity related marketing advertising taking order taking reservation reservation payment delivering vehicle could viewed state conducting unlicensed activity state otherwise violating state motor vehicle industry law . Regulators state may require u hold meet requirement appropriate dealer license state manufacturer prohibited acting dealer may otherwise prohibit impact planned activity . In jurisdiction Tesla store customer may try purchase vehicle internet . However state law providing manufacturer deliver vehicle resident state except dealer licensed business state may interpreted require u open store state order sell vehicle resident . In state opened viewing gallery full retail location possible state regulator could take position activity gallery constitute unlicensed motor vehicle dealership thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer law . Although would prefer state regulator address concern discussing concern u requesting voluntary compliance state could also take action u including levying fine requiring refrain certain activity . In addition state requirement service facility available respect vehicle sold state may interpreted also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet resident state thereby limiting ability sell vehicle state maintain service facility . The foregoing example state law governing sale motor vehicle regulation face sell vehicle .

California law potentially law state restrict ability licensed dealer advertise take deposit vehicle available . In November 2007 became aware New Motor Vehicle Board California Department Transportation considered whether reservation advertising policy comply law . To date received communication topic New Motor Vehicle Board Department Motor Vehicles DMV power enforce law . There assurance DMV take position vehicle reservation advertising practice violate law . We expect DMV determines may violated law would initially discus concern u request voluntary compliance . If ultimately found violation California law might precluded taking reservation payment DMV could take action u including levying fine requiring u refund reservation payment . Resolution inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspect reservation program . The DMV also power suspend license manufacture sell vehicle California following hearing merit typically exercised case significant repeat violation andor refusal comply DMV direction . Certain state may specific law apply dealer manufacturer selling directly consumer . For example state Washington requires reservation payment payment received resident state Washington must placed segregated account delivery vehicle account must unencumbered lien creditor dealer may used dealer . Consequently established segregated account reservation payment state Washington January 2010 . There assurance state foreign jurisdiction require similar segregation reservation payment received customer . Our inability access fund working capital purpose could harm liquidity . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle .

Risks uncertainty currently known u currently deem immaterial also may materially adversely affect business financial condition operating result . Risks Related Our Business Industry We may unable sustain current level production delivery Model S could harm business prospect . We began manufacturing delivering Model S June 2012 . We limited experience date high volume manufacturing electric vehicle recently reached full production Model S. Our ability maintain high volume Model S production depend upon number factor including supplier ability deliver quality part u timely manner ability use manufacturing process planned volume production maintaining desired quality level efficiently making design change ensure consistently high quality . The Model S new vehicle producing new employee using new equipment therefore production process still maturing . To produce vehicle meet quality standard requires u carefully analyze step production plan improve efficiency manufacturing process continue train employee . Our supplier also must produce new product sufficient quantity quality level meet demand . Certain supplier experienced delay meeting demand continue focus supplier capability constraint . Any disruption maintaining production level Model S could materially damage brand business prospect financial condition operating result . We recently increased Model S delivery rate United States match current anticipated Model S production capacity . We limited experience high volume delivery Model S vehicle recently reached steady state production rate 400 vehicle produced per week . Furthermore plan start European delivery Model S summer Asian delivery later 2013 limited experience delivering vehicle outside United States thus may face difficulty meeting delivery plan Europe Asia . If unable maintain weekly delivery rate match steady state production rate Model S ramp delivery Europe Asia sustain high level weekly Model S delivery throughout year could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . In addition Model S introducing number new manufacturing technology technique aluminum spot welding system widely adopted automotive industry Model S number new unique design feature 17 inch display screen newly designed retractable exterior door handle panoramic roof pose unique manufacturing challenge . 24 Table Contents Model S production delivery continue require significant resource may experience unexpected delay difficulty could harm ability maintain full manufacturing capacity Model S cause u miss planned production target could material adverse effect business prospect operating result financial condition . Additionally sustaining high volume production manner avoids significant cost overrun including result factor beyond control problem supplier vendor may difficult . Our ability sustain volume production delivery Model S subject certain risk uncertainty including supplier able deliver component timely basis necessary quantity quality acceptable price produce Model S volume reach financial target able complete necessary adjustment vehicle design manufacturing process Model S timely manner meet production plan allows high quality vehicle encounter part quality issue production Model S able schedule complete delivery planned volume production equipment tooling purchased select able accurately manufacture vehicle within specified design tolerance suffer unexpected breakdown damage could negatively affect rate needed produce vehicle volume able comply environmental workplace safety similar regulation operate manufacturing facility business projected timeline able maintain high quality control transition higher level inhouse manufacturing process information technology system currently expanding improving upon effective manage high volume production . Finally detailed longterm testing system integration performance safety well longterm quality reliability durability testing ongoing negative result testing could cause production delay Model S cost increase lower quality Model S vehicle . We dependent supplier vast majority single source supplier inability supplier continue deliver refusal deliver necessary component vehicle timely manner price quality level volume acceptable u would material adverse effect business prospect operating result . Model S contains numerous purchased part source globally 200 direct supplier vast majority currently single source supplier component . While obtain component multiple source whenever possible similar automobile manufacturer vast majority component used vehicle purchased u single source . To date qualified alternative source single sourced component used vehicle generally maintain longterm agreement supplier . While believe may able establish alternate supply relationship obtain engineer replacement component single source component may unable short term price cost favorable u . In particular believe able secure alternate source supply single sourced component relatively short time frame qualifying alternate supplier developing replacement certain highly customized component vehicle may time consuming costly may force u make additional modification vehicle design . 25 Table Contents This supply chain expose u multiple potential source delivery failure component shortage Model S well powertrain component sale activity . For example earthquake similar one occurred Japan March 2011 could negatively impact supply chain . We past experienced source disruption supply chain including relating slowerthananticipated ramp Model S production goal 2012 . We may experience additional delay future respect Model S future vehicle may produce . In addition written agreement place supplier may create uncertainty regarding certain supplier obligation u including limited regarding warranty product liability . Changes business condition war governmental change factor beyond control presently anticipate could also affect supplier ability deliver component u timely basis . Furthermore experience significant increased demand need replace certain existing supplier assurance additional supply component part available required term favorable u supplier would allocate sufficient supply u order meet requirement fill order timely manner . In past replaced certain supplier failure provide component met quality control standard . The loss single limited source supplier disruption supply component supplier could lead delay vehicle delivery customer could hurt relationship customer also materially adversely affect business prospect operating result . Changes supply chain resulted past may result future increased cost delay . We also experienced cost increase certain supplier order meet quality target development timeline well due design change made may experience similar cost increase future . Additionally negotiating existing supplier cost reduction seeking new le expensive supplier certain part attempting redesign certain part make cheaper produce . If unsuccessful effort control reduce supplier cost operating result suffer . Additionally cost reduction effort may interrupt harm normal production process thereby harming Model S quality reducing Model S production output . Furthermore failure supplier provide component timely manner level quality necessary manufacture performance electric vehicle Model S could prevent u fulfilling customer order timely fashion could result negative publicity damage brand material adverse effect business prospect financial condition operating result . If unable adequately reduce manufacturing cost Model S otherwise control cost associated operating business business financial condition operating result prospect suffer . Our production cost Model S high due startup cost Tesla Factory manufacturing inefficiency including low absorption fixed manufacturing cost higher logistics cost due immaturity supply chain higher initial price component part initial period launch ramp Model S. As producing car steady state production volume 400 vehicle per week manufacturing cost started fall . While expect cost reduction effort undertaken u supplier continue reduce cost 2013 guarantee able achieve planned cost reduction various cost saving initiative failure achieve saving would negatively affect ability reach gross margin profitability goal . We incur significant cost related procuring raw material required manufacture highperformance electric car assembling vehicle compensating personnel . We may also incur substantial cost increasing production capability Model S powertrain manufacturing facility could potentially face cost overrun . If Model S tooling production equipment part insufficient use Model X perhaps result lower level commonality two vehicle currently anticipate cost related production Model X may exceed expectation . 26 Table Contents Additionally future may required incur substantial marketing cost expense promote vehicle including use traditional medium television radio print even though marketing expense date relatively limited date relied upon unconventional marketing effort . If unable keep operating cost aligned level revenue generate operating result business prospect harmed . Furthermore many factor impact operating cost beyond control . For example cost raw material component lithiumion battery cell aluminum used produce body panel could increase due shortage global demand product increase . Indeed popularity electric vehicle exceeds current expectation without significant expansion battery cell production capacity advancement battery cell technology shortage could occur would result increased material cost u .

Adding artificial noise may cause current potential customer purchase electric vehicle would materially adversely affect business operating result financial condition prospect . Our limited operating history make evaluating business future prospect difficult may increase risk investment . You must consider risk difficulty face early stage company limited operating history . If successfully address risk business prospect operating result financial condition materially adversely harmed . We formed July 2003 began delivering first vehicle Tesla Roadster early 2008 . We began producing second electric vehicle Model S June 2012 production process continue mature . We historically derived revenue principally sale Tesla Roadster electric powertrain development service sale . Model S become primary contributor revenue starting fourth quarter 2012 . We intend longer term derive substantial revenue sale Model S Model X future electric vehicle . We limited operating history respect Model S. While expect Model S cost reduction effort undertaken u supplier continue reduce cost manufacturing Model S 2013 success timing effort difficult predict limit ability precisely forecast cost producing Model S. Further recently produced early prototype Model X crossover . Our vehicle design engineering manufacturing component supply plan Model S may continue adjusted . In addition powertrain component sale development service revenue powertrain research development compensation almost entirely generated arrangement Daimler AG Daimler Toyota Motor Corporation Toyota . It difficult predict future revenue appropriately budget expense limited insight trend may emerge affect business . In event actual result differ estimate adjust estimate future period operating result financial position could materially affected . We may fail meet publicly announced guidance expectation business would cause stock price decline . We provide guidance regarding expected financial business performance including projection regarding number vehicle hope sell future period anticipated future revenue gross margin . Correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition predicting future event inherently uncertain process .

Furthermore fluctuation shortage petroleum economic condition may cause u experience significant increase freight charge raw material cost . Substantial increase price raw material price charged u charged battery cell manufacturer would increase operating cost could reduce margin recoup increased cost increased electric vehicle price . There assurance able recoup increasing cost raw material increasing vehicle price . We also recently announced pricing U.S. Model S. Any attempt increase announced price response increased raw material cost could viewed negatively customer result cancellation Model S reservation could materially adversely affect brand image business prospect operating result . The new labeling requirement electric vehicle established United States Environmental Protection Agency require u affix label vehicle window regarding vehicle range capability differ previously announced range capability could negatively impact sale harm business . In July 2011 EPA amended requirement fuel economy sticker appear new alternative fueled car offered sale starting model year 2013 i.e . Monroney label . Prior amended requirement advertised planned offer Model S variety battery pack option estimated would offer range single charge 160 mile 230 mile 300 mile respectively traveling steady speed 55 mile per hour . The EPAs amended fuel economy sticker requirement however require u label Model S utilizing different energy efficiency testing methodology based five different test cycle i.e . 5cycle test . Based energy efficiency testing methodology range Model S vehicle equipped largest 85 kWh battery pack EPA certified range 265 mile single charge . The Model S vehicle equipped 60 kWh battery pack EPA certified range 208 mile single charge . Regardless range testing method actual driving range vary many reason including driving condition customer drive maintain vehicle external factor wind elevation change . Variations actual driving range experienced customer accurately reflected EPAs certified range could negatively impact customer perception negatively impact vehicle sale . Our success could harmed negative publicity regarding company product particularly Model S. From time time vehicle evaluated third party . For example show Top Gear air British Broadcasting Corporation review Tesla Roadster 2008 . Top Gear one 32 Table Contents watched automotive show world estimated 350 million viewer worldwide broadcast 100 country . Since originally airing fall 2008 episode Tesla Roadster rebroadcast repeatedly around world . The review Tesla Roadster included number significant falsehood regarding car performance range safety . Such criticism create negative public perception Tesla Roadster extent comment believed public may cause current potential customer purchase electric vehicle Model S Model X would materially adversely affect business operating result financial condition prospect . The range electric vehicle single charge decline time may negatively influence potential customer decision whether purchase vehicle . The range electric vehicle single charge decline principally function usage time charging pattern well factor . For example customer use Tesla vehicle well frequency charge battery pack Tesla vehicle result additional deterioration battery pack ability hold charge . For example currently expect battery pack Tesla Roadster retain approximately 6065 ability hold initial charge approximately 100000 mile seven year result decrease vehicle initial range . Such battery pack deterioration related decrease range power may negatively influence potential customer decision whether purchase vehicle may harm ability market sell vehicle . We dependent upon loan facility United States Department Energy . We relied DOE Loan Facility develop produce Model S develop Tesla Factory . Our DOE Loan Facility provided 465.0 million loan facility DOEs ATVM Program help finance development Model S including increase production capacity operation manufacturing facility finance build operation electric powertrain manufacturing facility . All advanced fund recent amendment DOE Loan Facility March 2013 repayable quarterly basis December 15 2017 . Our DOE Loan Facility document contain customary covenant include among others requirement project conducted accordance business plan project compliance requirement ATVM Program limitation subsidiary ability incur indebtedness incur lien make investment loan enter merger acquisition dispose asset pay dividend make distribution capital stock prepay indebtedness pay management advisory similar fee affiliate enter certain affiliate transaction enter new line business enter certain restrictive agreement . These restriction may limit ability operate business may cause u take action prevent u taking action believe necessary competitive standpoint otherwise believe necessary grow business . In addition DOE Loan Facility also contains variety customary financial covenant including covenant related current ratio leverage ratio interest coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio . We modified certain covenant February 2012 September 2012 March 2013 . If comply requirement DOE Loan Facility failure waived DOE could cause default DOE Loan Facility . In event default DOE could declare existing outstanding loan amount due immediately . Any acceleration repayment outstanding loan amount would materially adversely affect business prospect . If future able comply covenant including set forth may need seek additional waiver assurance DOE willing grant waiver time . We also crossdefault provision contract certain equipment lessor supplier pursuant event default DOE Loan Facility may result default contract could lead termination contract acceleration obligation payment liquidated damage andor repossession leased property equipment lessor . 33 Table Contents In addition DOE Loan Facility requires Mr. Musk certain affiliate one year complete project relating Model S Facility least 65 Tesla capital stock held date DOE Loan Facility failure comply would event default could result acceleration obligation DOE Loan Facility document exercise remedy DOE . We currently expanding improving information technology system . If implementation successful business operation could disrupted operating result could harmed . We currently expanding improving information technology system including implementing new internally developed system assist u management business . In particular volume production Model S necessitate development maintenance improvement information technology system include product data management procurement inventory management production planning execution sale logistics dealer management financial regulatory compliance system . These system support operation enable u produce Model S volume . The implementation maintenance improvement system require significant management time support cost . Moreover inherent risk associated developing improving expanding core system well implementing new system including disruption data management procurement process manufacturing execution finance supply chain sale process may affect ability manage data inventory procure part supply manufacture sell deliver vehicle Tesla store customer . We sure expanded system required functionality fully effectively implemented timely basis maintained . If successfully implement improve maintain system operation may disrupted operating result could harmed . In addition system functionality may operate expect may required expend significant resource correct problem find alternative source performing function . Our distribution model different predominant current distribution model automobile manufacturer make evaluating business operating result future prospect difficult . Our distribution model common automobile industry today particularly United States . We plan continue sell performance electric vehicle companyowned Tesla store internet . This model vehicle distribution relatively new unproven especially United States subject u substantial risk requires aggregate significant expenditure provides slower expansion distribution sale system may possible utilizing traditional dealer franchise system . For example able utilize longestablished sale channel developed franchise system increase sale volume may harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Moreover competing company wellestablished distribution channel . We opened Tesla store United States Europe Japan many open short period time . We limited experience distributing selling performance vehicle Tesla store . Our success depend large part ability effectively develop sale channel marketing strategy . Implementing business model subject numerous significant challenge including obtaining permit approval local state authority may successful addressing challenge . In April 2011 began roll new interactive store strategy . The concept layout new store located high profile retail center different previously used automotive sale . We know whether new store strategy successful consumer willing purchase vehicle manner location deemed comply applicable zoning restriction well approval acceptance specific high profile retail center seek locate store . As result may incur additional cost order improve change retail strategy . 34 Table Contents Other aspect distribution model also differ used traditional automobile manufacturer . For example sale Model S date made individual Model S reservation list wait Model S vehicle built take delivery . Moreover anticipate ever carry significant amount Model S inventory store even work current reservation list expect sufficient ongoing reservation customer usually need wait month time place order time receive vehicle . This type custom manufacturing unusual premium sedan market United States unproven whether average customer willing wait amount time vehicle . If customer embrace ordering retail experience business harmed . You must consider business prospect light risk uncertainty difficulty encounter implement business model . For instance need persuade customer supplier regulator validity sustainability business model . We certain able successfully address risk uncertainty difficulty business strategy face . Any failure successfully address risk uncertainty difficulty related business model would material adverse effect business prospect . We may face regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle directly internet could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . We sell vehicle Tesla store well internet . We may able sell vehicle sale model state United States many state law may interpreted prohibit internet sale manufacturer resident state impose limitation sale model including law prohibit manufacturer selling vehicle directly consumer without use independent dealership without physical presence state . For example state provide manufacturer deliver vehicle resident state except dealer licensed business state may interpreted require u open store state order sell vehicle resident . In state opened gallery location potential customer view vehicle full retail location possible state regulator could take position activity gallery constitute unlicensed motor vehicle dealership thereby violates applicable manufacturerdealer law . In addition state requirement service facility available respect vehicle sold state may interpreted also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet resident state thereby limiting ability sell vehicle state maintain service facility . The foregoing example state law governing sale motor vehicle regulation face sell vehicle . In many state application state motor vehicle law specific sale model largely untested state motor vehicle industry law particularly respect sale internet would determined fact specific analysis numerous factor including whether physical presence employee applicable state whether advertise conduct activity applicable state sale transaction structured volume sale state whether state question prohibits manufacturer acting dealer . As result fact specific untested nature issue fact applying law intended traditional automobile distribution model sale model allows interpretation discretion regulator manner applicable authority apply state law distribution model difficult predict . Such law well law governing motor vehicle industry may subject u potential inquiry investigation state motor vehicle regulator may question whether sale model complies applicable state motor vehicle industry law may require u change sale model may prohibit ability sell vehicle resident state . In addition decision regulator permitting u sell vehicle may subject challenge whether decision comply applicable state motor vehicle industry law . In October 2012 vehicle dealer association New York Massachusetts filed lawsuit revoke dealer license issued Tesla Motors New York New York limit business activity Tesla Motors MA 35 Table Contents Inc. Massachusetts . The Massachusetts lawsuit dismissed court favor December 2012 currently appealed plaintiff . Although believe Massachusetts New York law designed prevent distribution model challenge state possible similar challenge state successful could restrict prohibit ability sell vehicle resident state . In state Massachusetts Minnesota also legislative effort vehicle dealer association propose bill enacted would prevent u obtaining dealer license state given current sale model . We also registered motor vehicle manufacturer dealer Canada Australia Japan obtained license sell vehicle place Hong Kong Singapore . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Even jurisdiction analyzed law area complex difficult interpret may change time . Regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . Reservations Model S Model X fully refundable customer significant cancellation could harm financial condition business prospect operating result . As December 31 2012 138.8 million reservation payment primarily Model S Model X subject cancellation customer time customer enters purchase agreement . We experienced ongoing cancellation vehicle refund related reservation payment cancellation may continue . Given long lead time historically experienced customer reservation delivery Tesla Roadster Model S expect experience Model X heightened risk customer made reservation may ultimately take delivery vehicle due potential change customer preference competitive development factor . For example delayed introduction original Tesla Roadster fall 2007 experienced significant number customer cancelled reservation requested return reservation payment . Cancellations Model S recently increased asked numerous customer reservation list configure car delivery risk losing production slot andor 2012 pricing . Some customer also electing defer configuring car responded invitation configure car delivery . It possible portion customer ultimately cancel reservation thereby resulting higher cancellation rate experienced thus far . Furthermore encounter additional delay planned ramp Model S production introduction Model X believe significant number customer could similarly cancel reservation demand refund reservation payment . As result assurance made reservation cancelled ultimately result final purchase delivery sale vehicle . Given high level reservation significant cancellation could harm financial condition business prospect operating result . We may realize benefit Supercharger network could harm business brand operating result . We recently announced plan initial deployment United States Canada Tesla Supercharger network network charging station designed provide fastcharge capability owner Model S vehicle equipped Supercharger hardware . We intend expand Tesla Supercharger network throughout U.S. Canada Europe may unable due number factor including 36 Table Contents inability secure delay securing suitable location permit difficulty interfacing infrastructure various utility company greater expected cost difficulty installing maintaining operating network . We may also unable expand Supercharger network fast intend public expects place charging station place customer believe optimal . In addition announced charging customer access network significant unexpected cost encounter may harm operating result . Although Supercharger network intended address customer concern regarding longdistance travel network may result increased reservation sale Model S future vehicle . If Supercharger network expanded currently planned fast planned may realize benefit Supercharger network business operating result could materially affected . If unable design develop market sell new electric vehicle service address additional market opportunity business prospect operating result suffer . We may able successfully develop new electric vehicle service address new market segment develop significantly broader customer base . To date focused business sale highperformance electric vehicle targeted relatively affluent consumer . We need address additional market expand customer demographic order grow business . In particular intend Model S appeal customer premium vehicle much larger different demographic Tesla Roadster . Successfully offering vehicle vehicle class requires delivering vehicle higher standard fit finish interior exterior currently exists Tesla Roadster price competitive premium vehicle . Therefore assurance able deliver vehicle ultimately competitive premium vehicle market . In 2012 publicly revealed early prototype Model X crossover first vehicle intend develop leveraging Model S platform . We also previously announced intent develop third generation electric vehicle expect produce Tesla Factory introduction Model S Model X . However yet finalized design engineering component sourcing plan vehicle assurance able bring vehicle market price point volume currently intend . Our failure address additional market opportunity would harm business prospect financial condition operating result . If unable effectively leverage benefit using adaptable common platform architecture design manufacture future vehicle Model X business prospect operating result financial condition would adversely affected . We designed Model S adaptable platform architecture common electric powertrain use platform Model S create future electric vehicle including example Model X crossover vehicle . However experience using common platform design manufacture vehicle . The Model X design yet finalized may unable use adaptable Model S platform extent currently intend . Additionally intend use Model S manufacturing equipment part tooling production Model X . If tooling production equipment part insufficient use Model X perhaps result lower level commonality two vehicle anticipate cost related production Model X may exceed expectation . There assurance able use Model S platform bring future vehicle model including Model X crossover market faster inexpensively leveraging use common platform sufficient customer demand vehicle built Model S platform . We may experience significant delay design manufacture launch Model X could harm business prospect . We plan start Model X production late 2014 . Any significant delay design manufacture launch Model X could materially damage brand business prospect financial condition operating 37 Table Contents result . Automobile manufacturer often experience delay design manufacture commercial release new vehicle model . We experienced significant delay launching Tesla Roadster resulted additional cost adverse publicity business . In 2012 also experienced delay ramp Model S. We may experience similar delay cost overrun adverse publicity launching Model X could significant . We initial design development stage Model X . Furthermore yet evaluated qualified selected supplier planned production Model X . We may able engage supplier component timely manner acceptable price necessary quantity . We also need extensive testing ensure Model X compliance applicable NHTSA safety regulation obtain EPA CARB certification emission regulation prior beginning volume production delivery vehicle . In addition limited resource extent engineering manufacturing resource devoted design production Model S otherwise engaged development service activity may difficulty designing delivering Model X timely manner . If able manufacture deliver Model X timely manner consistent production timeline budget cost projection business prospect operating result financial condition negatively impacted ability grow business harmed . The automotive market highly competitive may successful competing industry . We currently face competition new established competitor expect face competition others future . The worldwide automotive market particularly alternative fuel vehicle highly competitive today expect become even future . Other automobile manufacturer entered electric vehicle market end 2010 expect additional competitor enter market . With respect Model S face competition existing future automobile manufacturer extremely competitive premium sedan market including Audi BMW Lexus Mercedes . Many established new automobile manufacturer entered announced plan enter alternative fuel vehicle market . In Japan Mitsubishi selling electric iMiEV since April 2010 . In December 2010 Nissan introduced United States Nissan Leaf fully electric vehicle Ford introduced pure electric Ford Focus plugin hybrid Ford CMax Energi Ford Fusion Energi 2012 plan introduce plugin hybrid Ford CMax 2012 . In addition several manufacturer including General Motors Toyota Ford Honda selling hybrid vehicle certain manufacturer announced plugin version hybrid vehicle . For example December 2010 General Motors introduced Chevrolet Volt plugin hybrid vehicle operates purely electric power limited number mile time internal combustion engine engages recharge battery pack . Moreover reported many large OEMs BMW Daimler Lexus Audi Renault Volkswagen also developing electric vehicle . Several new startup also entered announced plan enter market performance electric vehicle . Finally electric vehicle already brought market China foreign country expect number manufacturer enter United States market well . Most current potential competitor significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing resource may able devote greater resource design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale support product . Virtually competitor extensive customer base broader customer industry relationship . In addition almost company longer operating history greater name recognition . Our competitor may stronger position respond quickly new technology may able design develop market sell product effectively . Furthermore certain large automobile manufacturer offer financing leasing option vehicle also ability market vehicle substantial discount provided vehicle financed affiliated financing company . While entered preliminary agreement Athlon Car 38 Table Contents Lease leasing Model S selected European Nordic country currently offer lease financing Model S may put u competitive disadvantage compared large automobile manufacturer . We past currently offer customary discount vehicle . Additionally lack lease financing absence customary vehicle discount could put u competitive disadvantage . We expect competition industry intensify future light increased demand alternative fuel vehicle continuing globalization consolidation worldwide automotive industry . Factors affecting competition include product quality feature innovation development time pricing reliability safety fuel economy customer service financing term . Increased competition may lead lower vehicle unit sale increased inventory may result downward price pressure adversely affect business financial condition operating result prospect . Our ability successfully compete industry fundamental future success existing new market market share . There assurance able compete successfully market . If competitor introduce new car service compete surpass quality price performance car service may unable satisfy existing customer attract new customer price level would allow u generate attractive rate return investment . Increased competition could result price reduction revenue shortfall loss customer loss market share could harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Demand automobile industry highly volatile may lead lower vehicle unit sale adversely affect operating result . Volatility demand automobile industry may materially adversely affect business prospect operating result financial condition . The market currently compete plan compete future subject considerable volatility demand recent period . For example according automotive industry source sale passenger vehicle North America fourth quarter 2008 30 lower period prior year . Demand automobile sale depends large extent general economic political social condition given market introduction new vehicle technology . As new automobile manufacturer low volume producer le financial resource established automobile manufacturer withstand change market disruption demand . As business grows economic condition trend country region sell electric vehicle impact business prospect operating result well . Demand electric vehicle may also affected factor directly impacting automobile price cost purchasing operating automobile sale financing incentive price raw material part component cost fuel governmental regulation including tariff import regulation tax . Volatility demand may lead lower vehicle unit sale increased inventory may result downward price pressure adversely affect business prospect financial condition operating result . These effect may pronounced impact business given relatively smaller scale financial resource compared many incumbent automobile manufacturer . Difficult economic condition may negatively affect consumer purchase luxury item performance electric vehicle . Over last year deterioration global financial market continued challenging condition macroeconomic environment negatively impacted consumer spending believe adversely affected sale Tesla Roadster . The automobile industry particular severely impacted poor economic condition several vehicle manufacturing company including General Motors Chrysler forced file bankruptcy . Sales new automobile generally dropped recessionary period . Sales highend luxury consumer product performance electric vehicle depend part discretionary consumer spending even exposed adverse change general 39 Table Contents economic condition . Difficult economic condition could therefore temporarily reduce market vehicle price range . Discretionary consumer spending also affected factor including change tax rate tax credit interest rate availability term consumer credit . If current difficult economic condition continue worsen may experience decline demand reservation Model S future vehicle Model X could materially harm business prospect financial condition operating result . Accordingly event negative effect United States economy foreign economy negatively affect consumer confidence economy including disruption credit stock market actual perceived economic slowdown may harm business prospect financial condition operating result . We plan grow sale Europe Asia 2013 beyond . If significant slowdown continued downturn European economy prospect growth Europe could severally constrained . Our financial result may vary significantly periodtoperiod due seasonality business fluctuation operating cost . Our operating result may vary significantly periodtoperiod due many factor including seasonal factor may effect demand electric vehicle . Demand new car automobile industry general typically decline winter season sale generally higher spring summer month . Sales Tesla Roadster fluctuated seasonal basis increased sale spring summer month second third fiscal quarter relative fourth first fiscal quarter . We note general automotive sale tend decline winter season anticipate sale Model S Model X model introduce may similar seasonality . However limited operating history make difficult u judge exact nature extent seasonality business . Also unusually severe weather condition market may impact demand vehicle . Our operating result could also suffer achieve revenue consistent expectation seasonal demand many expense based anticipated level annual revenue . In addition expect periodtoperiod operating result vary based operating cost anticipate increase significantly future period among thing design develop manufacture Model X electric powertrain component increase production capacity manufacturing facility produce Model S electric powertrain component open new Tesla service center maintenance repair capability incur cost warranty repair product recall increase sale marketing activity increase general administrative function support growing operation . As result factor believe quartertoquarter comparison operating result especially shortterm necessarily meaningful comparison relied upon indicator future performance . Moreover operating result may meet expectation equity research analyst investor . If occurs trading price common stock could fall substantially either suddenly time . If unable establish maintain confidence longterm business prospect among consumer analyst within industry financial condition operating result business prospect stock price may suffer materially . Our vehicle highly technical product require maintenance support . If cease cut back operation even year buyer vehicle year earlier might much difficulty maintaining vehicle obtaining satisfactory support . As result consumer may le likely purchase vehicle convinced business succeed operation continue many year . Similarly supplier third party le likely invest time resource developing business relationship u convinced business succeed . For example economic downturn 2008 difficulty raising necessary funding operation result fourth quarter 2008 lay approximately 60 employee curtail expansion plan . In addition period number customer canceled previously 40 Table Contents placed reservation . If required take similar action future action may result negative perception regarding longterm business prospect may lead cancellation Model S Model X reservation . Accordingly order build maintain business must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst party liquidity longterm business prospect . In contrast established automaker believe case task maintaining confidence may particularly complicated factor following limited operating history limited revenue lack profitability date unfamiliarity uncertainty Model S Model X uncertainty longterm marketplace acceptance alternative fuel vehicle generally electric vehicle specifically prospect need ongoing infusion external capital fund planned operation size expansion plan comparison existing capital base scope history operation prospect actual emergence direct sustained competitive pressure established automaker may likely initial effort perceived commercially successful . Many factor largely outside control negative perception longterm business prospect even exaggerated unfounded would likely harm business make difficult raise additional fund needed . We may need want raise additional fund fund may available u need . If raise additional fund need want operation prospect could negatively affected . The design manufacture sale servicing automobile capital intensive business . As December 31 2012 approximately 226.1 million principal source liquidity cash cash equivalent restricted cash . This includes cash cash equivalent amount approximately 201.9 million includes investment money market fund well restricted cash 24.3 million . We expect principal source liquidity provide u adequate liquidity reach expected profitability 2013 based current plan . However cost developing manufacturing Model S variant Model X exceed expectation incur significant unplanned expense embark accelerate new significant strategic investment may need raise additional fund issuance equity equityrelated debt security obtaining credit government financial institution . This capital necessary fund ongoing operation continue research development project including planned Model X crossover establish sale service center make investment tooling manufacturing capital required introduce Model X . We certain additional fund available u favorable term required . If raise additional fund need financial condition result operation business prospect could materially adversely affected . Additionally DOE Loan Facility face restriction ability incur additional indebtedness future may need obtain waiver DOE order . We may able obtain waiver DOE may harm business . Future issuance equity equityrelated security dilute ownership interest existing stockholder issuance debt security could increase risk perceived risk company . 41 Table Contents We relied DOE Loan Facility develop produce Model S develop Tesla Factory . We currently similar type loan facility place Model X future vehicle . In addition recently begun accept customer reservation payment Model X provide assurance customer willing make payment accordingly may reliant source fund development vehicle . We limited experience servicing vehicle using different service model one typically used industry . If unable address service requirement existing future customer business materially adversely affected . If unable successfully address service requirement existing future customer meet customer expectation regarding service business prospect materially adversely affected . We produced delivered limited number Roadsters Model S vehicle . We limited experience servicing vehicle particularly Model S vehicle . Servicing electric vehicle different servicing vehicle internal combustion engine requires specialized skill including high voltage training servicing technique . If unable satisfactorily service customer various service related issue facing may face future ability generate customer loyalty grow business sell additional Model S vehicle could impaired . We service performance electric vehicle companyowned Tesla service center certain store mobile service technician known Tesla Rangers . However certain service center open short period date limited experience servicing performance vehicle location We need open new standalone service center hire train significant number new employee staff service center act Tesla Rangers order successfully maintain fleet delivered performance electric vehicle . We implemented Tesla Rangers program October 2009 limited experience deploying service customer vehicle . There assurance service arrangement limited experience servicing vehicle adequately address service requirement customer satisfaction sufficient resource meet service requirement timely manner volume vehicle able deliver annually increase . We expect able open Tesla service center geographic area existing potential customer may reside . In order address service need customer geographical proximity service center plan either transport vehicle nearest Tesla store service center servicing deploy mobile Tesla Rangers service vehicle customer location . These special arrangement may expensive may able recoup cost providing service customer . In addition number potential customer may choose purchase vehicle lack widespread service network . If adequately address customer service need brand reputation adversely affected turn could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . Traditional automobile manufacturer United States provide maintenance repair service directly . Consumers must rather service vehicle franchised dealership third party maintenance service provider . We arrangement third party service provider unclear even whether third party service provider able acquire expertise service vehicle . At point anticipate providing substantially service vehicle foreseeable future . As vehicle placed location may encounter negative reaction consumer frustrated use local service station extent conventional automobile frustration may result negative publicity reduced sale thereby harming business prospect . 42 Table Contents In addition motor vehicle industry law many state require service facility available respect vehicle physically sold location state . Whether law would also require service facility available respect vehicle sold internet consumer state physical presence uncertain . While believe Tesla Ranger program practice shipping customer vehicle nearest Tesla store service would satisfy regulator circumstance without seeking formal regulatory guidance assurance regulator attempt require provide physical service facility state . Further certain state franchise law prohibit manufacturer licensed dealer acting capacity dealer also restrict manufacturer providing vehicle service . If issue arise connection law certain aspect Teslas service program would need restructured comply state law may harm business . We may succeed maintaining strengthening Tesla brand would materially adversely affect customer acceptance vehicle component business revenue prospect . Our business prospect heavily dependent ability develop maintain strengthen Tesla brand . Any failure develop maintain strengthen brand may materially adversely affect ability sell Tesla Roadster Model S Model X future planned electric vehicle sell electric powertrain component . If continue establish maintain strengthen brand may lose opportunity build critical mass customer . Promoting positioning brand likely depend significantly ability provide high quality electric car maintenance repair service limited experience area . Any problem associated launch Toyota RAV4 EV us Tesla powertrain future Daimler vehicle use Tesla powertrains Model X may hurt Tesla brand . In addition expect ability develop maintain strengthen Tesla brand also depend heavily success marketing effort . To date limited experience marketing activity relied primarily internet word mouth attendance industry trade show promote brand . To promote brand may required change marketing practice could result substantially increased advertising expense including need use traditional medium television radio print . The automobile industry intensely competitive may successful building maintaining strengthening brand . Many current potential competitor particularly automobile manufacturer headquartered Detroit Japan European Union greater name recognition broader customer relationship substantially greater marketing resource . If develop maintain strong brand business prospect financial condition operating result materially adversely impacted . If vehicle owner customize vehicle change charging infrastructure aftermarket product vehicle may operate properly could harm business . Automobile enthusiast may seek hack vehicle modify performance could compromise vehicle safety system . Also aware customer customized vehicle aftermarket part may compromise driver safety . For example customer installed seat elevate driver airbag safety system could compromised . Other customer changed wheel tire others installed large speaker system may impact electrical system vehicle . We tested endorse change product . In addition customer use improper external cabling unsafe charging outlet expose customer injury high voltage electricity . Such unauthorized modification could reduce safety vehicle injury resulting modification could result adverse publicity would negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . 43 Table Contents Regulators could review practice taking reservation payment practice deemed violate applicable law could required pay penalty refund reservation payment stop accepting additional reservation payment restructure certain aspect reservation program . For customer interested making reservation Model S Model X require initial fully refundable reservation payment least 5000 . As December 31 2012 collected reservation payment primarily Model S Model X aggregate amount 138.8 million . We generally use fund working capital general corporate purpose . California law potentially law state restrict ability licensed auto dealer advertise take deposit vehicle vehicle available dealer manufacturer . In November 2007 became aware New Motor Vehicle Board California Department Transportation considered whether reservation policy advertising comply California Vehicle Code . To date received communication topic New Motor Vehicle Board Department Motor Vehicles DMV power enforce law . There assurance DMV take position vehicle reservation advertising practice violate law . In addition California currently jurisdiction license manufacture sell vehicle limitation imposed operation California may particularly damaging business . The DMV also power suspend license manufacture sell vehicle California following hearing merit typically exercised case significant repeat violation andor refusal comply DMV direction . Certain state may specific law apply reservation payment accepted dealer manufacturer selling directly consumer . For example state Washington requires reservation payment payment received resident state Washington must placed segregated account delivery vehicle account must unencumbered lien creditor dealer may used dealer . Consequently established segregated account reservation payment state Washington January 2010 . There assurance state foreign jurisdiction require similar segregation reservation payment received customer . Our inability access fund working capital purpose could harm liquidity . Furthermore performed analysis principal law European Union relating distribution model believe comply law performed complete analysis foreign jurisdiction may sell vehicle . Accordingly may law jurisdiction yet entered law unaware jurisdiction entered may restrict vehicle reservation practice business practice . Reductions cash result redemption inability take reservation payment could make necessary raise additional fund also make difficult u obtain additional financing . The prospect reduction cash even unrealized may also make difficult obtain financing . Our plan expand network Tesla store require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale electric vehicle . In addition may able open store certain state . Our plan expand network Tesla store require significant cash investment management resource may meet expectation respect additional sale electric vehicle . This planned global expansion Tesla store may desired effect increasing sale expanding brand presence degree anticipating . Furthermore assurance able construct additional storefront budget timeline established . We also need ensure compliance regulatory requirement applicable sale vehicle jurisdiction could take considerable time expense . If experience delay expanding network Tesla store could lead decrease sale vehicle could negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We opened Tesla store major metropolitan area throughout North America Europe Asia . We plan open additional store goal establishing approximately 50 store globally within next several year connection Model S rollout . However may able expand network rate planned expansion network Tesla store require significant cash investment management resource well efficiency execution establishing storefront hiring training necessary employee effectively sell vehicle . 44 Table Contents Furthermore certain state foreign jurisdiction may permit requirement franchise dealer law similar law regulation may preclude restrict ability open store sell vehicle state jurisdiction . Any prohibition restriction may lead decreased sale jurisdiction could harm business prospect operating result . See Risk Factor We may face regulatory limitation ability sell vehicle directly internet could materially adversely affect ability sell electric vehicle . We face risk associated international operation including unfavorable regulatory political tax labor condition could harm business . We face risk associated international operation including possible unfavorable regulatory political tax labor condition could harm business . We currently international operation subsidiary various country jurisdiction subject legal political regulatory social requirement economic condition jurisdiction . Additionally part growth strategy intend expand sale maintenance repair service internationally . However limited experience date selling servicing vehicle internationally expansion would require u make significant expenditure including hiring local employee establishing facility advance generating revenue . We subject number risk associated international business activity may increase cost impact ability sell electric vehicle require significant management attention . These risk include conforming vehicle various international regulatory safety requirement vehicle sold homologation difficulty staffing managing foreign operation difficulty attracting customer new jurisdiction foreign government tax regulation permit requirement including foreign tax may able offset tax imposed upon u United States foreign tax law limiting ability repatriate fund United States fluctuation foreign currency exchange rate interest rate including risk related interest rate swap hedging activity undertake ability enforce contractual intellectual property right especially foreign country respect protect intellectual property right extent United States Japan European country increase risk unauthorized uncompensated use technology United States foreign government trade restriction tariff price exchange control foreign labor law regulation restriction preference foreign nation domestically produced vehicle change diplomatic trade relationship political instability natural disaster war event terrorism strength international economy . If fail successfully address risk business prospect operating result financial condition could materially harmed . 45 Table Contents Foreign currency movement relative U.S. dollar could harm financial result . Our revenue cost denominated foreign currency completely matched . For example portion cost expense year ended December 31 2012 denominated foreign currency including Japanese yen euro British pound Conversely period remainder 2012 time begin shipping significant quantity Model S vehicle foreign jurisdiction expect significant majority revenue denominated U.S. dollar . Accordingly value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . As result operating result could adversely affected . In future begin selling Model S overseas well delivering powertrain unit Daimler may greater revenue cost denominated currency case strengthening dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar . Developments alternative technology improvement internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect demand electric vehicle . Significant development alternative technology advanced diesel ethanol fuel cell compressed natural gas improvement fuel economy internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect business prospect way currently anticipate . Any failure u develop new enhanced technology process react change existing technology could materially delay development introduction new enhanced electric vehicle could result loss competitiveness vehicle decreased revenue loss market share competitor . The unavailability reduction elimination government economic incentive could material adverse effect business financial condition operating result prospect . Any reduction elimination discriminatory application government subsidy economic incentive policy change reduced need subsidy incentive due perceived success electric vehicle fiscal tightening reason may result diminished competitiveness alternative fuel vehicle industry generally electric vehicle particular . This could materially adversely affect growth alternative fuel automobile market business prospect financial condition operating result . Our growth depends part availability amount government subsidy economic incentive alternative fuel vehicle generally performance electric vehicle specifically . For example currently benefit exemption California state sale use tax purchase 612 million manufacturing equipment arrangement California Alternative Energy Advanced Transportation Financing Authority . To extent equipment purchased would otherwise subject California state sale use tax believe incentive would result tax saving u January 2015 . This exemption available equipment would otherwise subject California sale use tax would used specified purpose . If fail meet condition would unable take full advantage tax incentive financial position could harmed . In addition certain regulation law encourage sale electric car tax credit subsidy could reduced eliminated applied way creates adverse effect vehicle either currently time future . For example federal state government time time enacted tax credit incentive purchase alternative fuel car funding program limited guarantee vehicle eligible tax credit incentive provided alternative fuel vehicle future . This would put vehicle competitive disadvantage . As example state level California renewed Clean Vehicle Rebate Program 2012 rebate program purchase qualified alternative technology vehicle . California reduced rebate amount 5000 per vehicle 2500 per vehicle due fewer fund available increased demand fund may run . 46 Table Contents Subsequent purchaser could face delay receiving rebate since would wait next fiscal year funding became available unable obtain rebate . As additional example considerable discussion federal level tax reform . Discussions included reducing even eliminating current 7500 tax credit available purchaser qualified alternative fuel vehicle including Model S. Also government disincentive enacted Europe gaspowered vehicle discourage use vehicle allow u set higher sale price Tesla Roadster Europe . In event disincentive reduced eliminated sale electric vehicle including Tesla Roadster Model S could adversely affected . Furthermore low volume manufacturer exempt certain regulatory requirement United States European Union . This provides u advantage high volume manufacturer must comply regulation . Once reach certain threshold number sale United States European Union longer able take advantage exemption respective jurisdiction could lead u incur additional design manufacturing expense . We anticipate able take advantage exemption respect Model S plan produce significantly higher volume Tesla Roadster . If unable grow sale electric vehicle component original equipment manufacturer financial result may suffer . We may trouble attracting retaining powertrain customer could adversely affect business prospect result . Daimler affiliate Toyota affiliate currently customer electric powertrain sale development service . In 2012 entered development agreement development full electric powertrain Daimler MercedesBenz Bclass EV end 2013 . We however yet completed development activity entered agreement supply Daimler production electric powertrain system . Should occur future sale growth financial result would adversely affected . In July 2011 entered supply service agreement Toyota supply validated electric powertrain system including battery pack charging system inverter motor gearbox associated software integrated electric vehicle version Toyota RAV4 . Pursuant agreement expect Toyota pay u approximately 100 million 2012 2014 based delivery electric powertrain system . The payment u Toyota agreement guaranteed occur upon delivery powertrain system meet Toyotas specification . Toyota obligated buy system u Toyota order anticipated system u receive revenue anticipate agreement . This agreement requires meet customary obligation timely delivery warranty product quality obligation . Our failure meet obligation could materially adverse impact operating result . Additionally although discussed new business opportunity Daimler Toyota guarantee able reach agreement Daimler Toyota respective affiliate regarding opportunity term condition favorable u .

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion analysis read conjunction consolidated financial statement related note appear elsewhere Annual Report Form 10K . Overview 2012 Highlights We design develop manufacture sell highperformance fully electric vehicle advanced electric vehicle powertrain component . We introduced first vehicle Tesla Roadster early 2008 . The Roadsters proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system foundation powertrain technology design enhancement form basis Model S sedan Model X crossover future vehicle . We targeting second vehicle Model S sedan significantly broader customer base Tesla Roadster manufacturing Model S significantly higher volume Tesla Roadster . We commenced delivery Model S June 2012 increased production annualized rate 20000 per year end 2012 . In February 2012 revealed early prototype Model X crossover vehicle based Model S platform . We plan start Model X production late 2014 . We sell vehicle sale service network . During year ended December 31 2012 recognized total revenue 413.3 million increase 102 total revenue 204.2 million year ended December 31 2011 . Automotive sale revenue 385.7 million increased 160 year ended December 31 2011 driven commencement Model S delivery North America regulatory credit sale customer demand remaining Tesla Roadsters internationally partially offset lower powertrain component sale . Lower powertrain component sale resulted completion Daimler AG Daimler Smart fortwo AClass EV program end 2011 partially offset powertrain system began sell Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV 2012 . Development service revenue decreased 27.6 million year ended December 31 2012 55.7 million year ended December 31 2011 due primarily completion development activity Toyota RAV4 EV program first quarter 2012 . In 2012 began work full electric powertrain MercedesBenz BClass EV program . The majority 2012 development service revenue achievement milestone delivery prototype sample Daimler program . In June 2012 commenced delivery Model S customer United States . Our timely launch Model S represented important milestone transitioning u significant activity Model S development preparation vehicle manufacturing Tesla Factory process ramping volume production month followed . Gross margin year ended December 31 2012 7.3 . Although produced 3100 Model S vehicle year still experienced significant earlystage higher per unit cost inefficiency production ramp June December result lower fixed cost absorption manufacturing inefficiency associated initial production ramp higher logistics cost supply chain process continued mature . We also higher component price many vendor supplying part production price later planned due manufacturing inefficiency . Research development RD expense included expense related Model S preproduction activity including manufacturing preparedness process validation prototype build extensive testing vehicle component level development Tesla Factory development testing Model S including activity homologate Model S rest world introduce 60 kWh 40 kWh battery pack option development design engineering activity related Model X research development activity . Research development expense year ended December 31 2012 274.0 million compared 209.0 million year ended December 31 2011 . As Model S production Tesla Factory became fully operational 2012 Model S related manufacturing cost including direct part material labor cost manufacturing overhead amortized tooling logistics longer captured RD expense instead fully reflected cost automotive sale . 66 Table Contents Significant construction activity took place 2012 readied Tesla Factory begin production Model S. During first half year completed installation Model S manufacturing equipment tested qualified manufacturing equipment continued finetune production process incorporating higher percentage productionintent component Model S vehicle . By midyear significant portion Model S manufacturingrelated asset ready intended use began depreciate asset . As result investment made Tesla Factory related supplier tooling Model S capital expenditure increased 239.2 million year ended December 31 2012 compared 184.2 million year ended December 31 2011 . During year expanded companyowned retail network opening several store service center primarily United States . At year end 32 store gallery around world . We also successfully launched Supercharger network California well first two Superchargers east coast . With higher expense associated expansion store network service infrastructure well growth business general incurred selling general administrative expense 150.4 million year ended December 31 2012 compared 104.1 million year ended December 31 2011 . We ended year 221.0 million cash cash equivalent current restricted cash . In addition cash received revenue generating reservationtaking activity funded operation 2012 primarily proceeds followon offering fully drawing Department Energy Loan Facility DOE Loan Facility well careful working capital management . In October 2012 completed followon offering 7964601 share common stock received cash proceeds 222.1 million transaction net underwriting discount included 35398 share sold Elon Musk Chief Executive Officer cofounder aggregate amount 1.0 million . During year ended December 31 2012 received 188.8 million drawdowns DOE Loan Facility completed draw 465.0 million facility . During fourth quarter made first quarterly principal payment 12.7 million repay loan DOE schedule . Additionally set aside 14.6 million second quarterly DOE payment due March 2013 classified current restricted cash . In March 2013 entered fourth amendment DOE Loan Facility . For information see Note 8 Consolidated Financial Statements included Annual Report Form 10K Item 8 . Financial Statements Supplemental Data . We expect current source liquidity together current projection cash flow operating activity provide u adequate liquidity attempt reach profitability 2013 based current plan . Additionally currently expect near breakeven cash flow operation first quarter 2013 . Management Opportunities Challenges Risks Our principal focus 2012 completing development Model S establishing manufacturing capability Tesla Factory launching Model S ramping production rate . While successfully commenced delivery Model S customer United States June 2012 attention second half 2012 switched continued refinement manufacturing supply chain process enable high volume production Tesla Factory maintaining high quality standard . By year end successfully increased production volume 400 vehicle per week three consecutive week December . This established production level allow u achieve goal 20000 Model S delivery 2013 provided also ramp delivery rate . Having achieved steadystate production level 2012 expect automotive sale increase significantly 2013 compared 2012 . We plan start European delivery Model S summer 67 Table Contents Asian delivery later 2013 . In addition started delivering Model S 60 kWh battery pack delivery car 40 kWh battery pack expected begin summer . We offer variety method customer take delivery Model S including delivery home Tesla Factory . In order ramp delivery Model S meet forecasted sale made continue make enhancement delivery process . Should delivery process enhancement achieve objective timing automotive sale recognition delayed significant impact projected growth revenue . In addition sale Model S continue recognize automotive sale supply powertrain component system Toyota Toyota RAV4 EV lesser extent sale Tesla Roadster . During first quarter 2012 began shipping powertrain system Toyota supply service agreement Toyota RAV4 EV . Pursuant agreement Toyota pay u approximately 100 million 2012 2014 based delivery powertrain system Toyota RAV4 EV . In January 2012 concluded production run current generation Tesla Roadster 2500 vehicle . As December 31 2012 sold remaining Roadsters . In 2012 began work full electric powertrain MercedesBenz BClass EV program . Under program continue provide development service deliver prototype sample 2013 . Similar previous development service agreement due timing difference may arise recognition milestone revenue underlying cost development service gross margin development service activity may vary period period . Although produced 3100 Model S vehicle 2012 still experienced higher per unit cost latter part year result lower fixed cost absorption manufacturing inefficiency associated initial production ramp higher logistics cost supply chain process continued mature . We also higher component price many vendor supplied part production price later planned due manufacturing inefficiency . As enter 2013 production efficiency per vehicle basis improving substantially continue stabilize improve production process cost reduction effort undertaken u supplier continue sell regulatory credit . We expect first quarter material labor overhead cost substantially lower fourth quarter 2012 trend continue throughout 2013 . We expect gross margin first quarter 2013 exceed fourth quarter 2012 continue rise target 25 second half 2013 despite anticipated decrease Model S average selling price resulting introduction lower priced Model S battery variant much lower contribution regulatory credit sale partially offset higher average selling price international sale begin second half increase fourth quarter 2013 . There guarantee able achieve planned cost reduction various cost saving initiative would negatively affect ability reach gross margin goal . Longer term regulatory credit revenue decline relative automotive sale grow sale outside United States earn fewer credit lower priced Model S battery variant While pursue opportunity monetize credit earn sale vehicle plan rely sale significant contributor gross margin business model predicated regulatory credit . However unable sell regulatory credit short term revenue gross margin profitability would negatively impacted . In February 2012 revealed early prototype Model X crossover first vehicle intend develop leveraging Model S platform . We currently plan start production Model X late 2014 . Our ability develop introduce Model X timeframe based partially expectation 68 Table Contents leveraging Model S platform . If lower level commonality Model S Model X anticipated future development tooling cost may exceed expectation . At year end 32 store gallery around world . We plan open 15 20 store gallery 2013 half opening Europe Asia support expansion region second half 2013 . Notably already started construction first store Beijing China preparation planned opening spring . At end 2012 also 29 service location around world . We plan double number end 2013 keep pace growing fleet customer car . In 2012 invited large number reservation holder configure car . Converting reservation firm nonrefundable order increased cancellation expected . After delivery cancellation net reservation December 31 2012 15000 . New reservation continue steady although slower pace first quarter 2013 compared December 2012 due part pull ahead reservation 2012 customer seeking avoid announced 2013 price increase . First quarter 2013 cancellation likely remain elevated remaining older reservation holder invited configure vehicle within set timeframe pay higher price like new reservation holder . In 2012 successfully launched Superchargers California east coast United States . Construction planning underway install additional Superchargers 2013 . Our plan expand coverage U.S. west east coast around rest country . Through combination improved gross margin lower research development expense well measured spending support expansion sale service infrastructure general growth business expect profitable first quarter 2013 experience breakeven cash flow operation . The achievement operational manufacturing efficiency drive adjustment personnel primarily affecting contractor temporary employee . At time continuing hire convert fulltime key talent required . In 2013 plan spend significantly le capital expenditure 2012 concluded majority investment Tesla Factory Model S tooling . This reduction partially offset expenditure related expanding service store network investing new capital equipment tooling reduce variable cost new product development . Critical Accounting Policies Estimates Our consolidated financial statement prepared accordance accounting principle generally accepted United States . The preparation consolidated financial statement requires u make estimate assumption affect reported amount asset liability revenue cost expense related disclosure . We base estimate historical experience appropriate various assumption believe reasonable circumstance . Changes accounting estimate reasonably likely occur period period . Accordingly actual result could differ significantly estimate made management . We evaluate estimate assumption ongoing basis . To extent material difference estimate actual result future financial statement presentation financial condition result operation cash flow affected . We believe following critical accounting policy involve greater degree judgment complexity accounting policy . Accordingly policy believe critical understanding evaluating consolidated financial condition result operation . Revenue Recognition Automotive Sales We recognize automotive sale revenue sale Model S Tesla Roadster including vehicle option accessory destination charge vehicle service sale regulatory credit zero emission vehicleZEV greenhouse gas emission GHG credit . We also recognize automotive sale revenue sale electric vehicle powertrain component system battery pack drive unit manufacturer . We recognize revenue persuasive evidence arrangement exists ii delivery occurred uncertainty regarding customer acceptance iii fee fixed determinable iv collection reasonably assured . 69 Table Contents Automotive sale consist primarily revenue earned sale vehicle . Sales amount collected advance meeting revenue recognition criterion recognized consolidated statement operation instead recorded deferred revenue consolidated balance sheet . Prior February 2010 provide direct financing purchase Tesla Roadster although thirdparty lender provided financing arrangement customer United States . Under arrangement paid full customer time purchase . Starting February 2010 began offering Tesla Roadster leasing program qualified customer United States . Automotive sale also consist revenue earned sale vehicle option accessory destination charge . While sale may take place separately vehicle sale often part one vehicle sale agreement resulting multiple element arrangement . To determine appropriate accounting recognition revenue consider whether deliverable specified multiple element arrangement treated separate unit accounting price allocated among element recognize revenue element period revenue recognized . We also evaluate whether delivered item value standalone basis prior delivery remaining item determining whether made separate sale item whether undelivered item essential functionality delivered item . Further ass whether know fair value undelivered item determined reference standalone sale item . To date able establish fair value deliverable within multiple element arrangement sell vehicle vehicle accessory option separately outside multiple element arrangement . As item stand alone value customer revenue sale vehicle accessory option recognized specific item delivered customer . Increased complexity sale agreement change judgment estimate regarding application revenue recognition guideline could result change timing amount revenue recognized future period . For multiple deliverable revenue arrangement allocate revenue element based selling price hierarchy . The selling price deliverable based vendor specific objective evidence VSOE available third party evidence TPE VSOE available estimated selling price neither VSOE TPE available . To date able establish fair value deliverable within multiple element arrangement sell vehicle vehicle accessory option separately outside multiple element arrangement . Therefore material difference total revenue reported pro forma total revenue would reported year ended December 31 2011 transaction entered materially modified January 1 2011 subject previous accounting guidance . Regulatory Credit Sales California certain state law place requiring vehicle manufacturer ensure portion vehicle delivered sale state model year zero emission vehicle . These law regulation provide manufacturer zero emission vehicle may earn regulatory credit may sell excess credit manufacturer apply credit comply regulatory requirement . Similar regulation exist federal level require compliance related greenhouse gas GHG emission also allow sale excess credit one manufacturer manufacturer . As manufacturer solely zero emission vehicle earned regulatory credit ZEV GHG credit vehicle expect continue earn credit future . Since commercial vehicle electric receive compliance benefit generation credit accordingly look sell vehicle manufacturer . In order facilitate sale credit enter contractual agreement third party requiring purchase regulatory credit predetermined price . We recognize revenue sale credit time legal title credit transferred purchasing party governmental agency issuing credit . 70 Table Contents Development Services Revenue development service arrangement consist revenue earned development electric vehicle powertrain component system automobile manufacturer including design development battery pack drive unit sample vehicle meet customer specification . Revenue recognized development arrangement finalized performance requirement development arrangement met collection reasonably assured .
