Problems delay bringing Gigafactory online operating line expectation could negatively affect production profitability product Model 3 Tesla Energy product . To lower cost cell production produce cell high volume intend integrate production lithiumion cell finished battery pack vehicle including Model 3 Tesla Energy product new Gigafactory . We limited experience building factory direct experience production lithiumion cell . Also cost complexity building operating Gigafactory could exceed current expectation Gigafactory may take longer bring online lithiumion cell battery pack production anticipate . If unable build Gigafactory timely manner produce high volume quality lithiumion cell reasonable price ability supply battery pack vehicle product according schedule andor price allows u sell profitably quantity estimate could constrained . Any problem delay Gigafactory could negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . If vehicle vehicle contain powertrains fail perform expected ability develop market sell electric vehicle could harmed . If vehicle vehicle contain powertrains contain defect design manufacture cause perform expected require repair ability develop market sell vehicle could harmed . For example operation vehicle highly dependent software inherently complex could conceivably contain defect error . Issues historically experienced customer include related software 17 inch display screen panoramic roof 12 volt battery Model S. Although attempt remedy issue observe vehicle effectively rapidly possible effort may timely may hamper production may satisfaction customer . While performed extensive internal testing currently limited frame reference evaluate longterm performance battery pack powertrains vehicle Tesla Energy product .

Any vehicle product defect failure vehicle perform expected could harm reputation result delivery delay product recall product liability claim significant warranty expense could material adverse impact business financial condition operating result prospect . Our Model X vehicle yet evaluated NHTSA 5Star Safety Ratings based internal testing expect obtain comparable rating achieved Model S assurance occur . We dependent supplier majority single source supplier inability supplier continue deliver refusal deliver necessary component vehicle timely manner price quality level volume acceptable u would material adverse effect financial condition operating result . Model S Model X contain numerous purchased part source globally hundred direct supplier majority currently single source supplier despite effort qualify obtain component multiple source whenever possible . Furthermore maintain longterm agreement number supplier . 14 While may able establish alternate supply relationship engineer replacement component single source component may unable short term price cost favorable u . In particular believe able secure alternate source supply single sourced component relatively short time frame qualifying alternate supplier developing replacement certain highly customized component vehicle may time consuming costly may force u make additional modification vehicle design . This limited supply chain expose u multiple potential source delivery failure component shortage production vehicle powertrain component . We may experience delay due supply chain disruption respect Model S Model X Model 3 future vehicle may produce experienced 2012 connection slowerthananticipated Model S ramp . In addition currently ongoing transition low high volume production tooling Model X may take longer expected may adversely impact shortterm financial result . Changes business condition labor issue war governmental change natural disaster March 2011 earthquake Japan factor beyond control presently anticipate could also affect supplier ability deliver component u timely basis . Furthermore experience significantly increased demand need replace certain existing supplier assurance additional supply component part available required term favorable u supplier would allocate sufficient supply u order meet requirement fill order timely manner could engineer replacement component . Changes supply chain resulted past may result future increased cost . We also experienced cost increase certain supplier order meet quality target development timeline well due design change made may experience similar cost increase future . Additionally negotiating existing supplier cost reduction seeking new le expensive supplier certain part attempting redesign certain part make le expensive produce . If unsuccessful effort control reduce supplier cost operating result suffer . Finally October 2013 entered amendment existing supply agreement Panasonic Corporation order address anticipated short mediumterm lithiumion battery cell need . While expect supply agreement amended provide u sufficient cell next year may able meet longterm need including Model 3 program may introduce without securing additional supplier source cell .

As gradually ramped production Model S manufacturing cost per vehicle decreased . While expect ongoing cost reduction realized u supplier guarantee able achieve sufficient cost saving reach gross margin profitability goal . We incur significant cost related procuring raw material required manufacture vehicle assembling vehicle compensating personnel . We may also incur substantial cost cost overrun increasing production capability Model S Model X powertrain manufacturing facility . Furthermore unable produce Model X pursuant plan due cost overrun unexpected cost may able meet gross margin financial target . Furthermore many factor impact operating cost beyond control potential increase cost raw material component lithiumion battery cell aluminum used produce body panel . If unable keep operating cost aligned level revenue generate operating result business prospect harmed . We may fail meet publicly announced guidance expectation business would cause stock price decline . We occasionally provide guidance regarding expected financial business performance projection regarding sale production well anticipated future revenue gross margin profitability cash flow . Correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition predicting future event inherently uncertain process guidance may ultimately accurate . Our guidance based certain assumption relating anticipated production sale volume average sale price supplier commodity cost planned cost reduction . If guidance accurate varies actual result due inability meet assumption impact financial performance could occur result various risk uncertainty market value common stock could decline significantly . Our vehicle make use lithiumion battery cell observed catch fire vent smoke flame event raised concern future event may lead additional concern battery used automotive application . The battery pack produce make use lithiumion cell . On rare occasion lithiumion cell rapidly release energy contain venting smoke flame manner ignite nearby material well lithiumion cell . While designed battery pack passively contain single cell release energy without spreading neighboring cell . There assurance field testing failure vehicle battery pack produce occur could subject u lawsuit product recall redesign effort would time consuming expensive . Also negative public perception regarding suitability lithiumion cell automotive application future incident involving lithiumion cell vehicle fire even incident involve vehicle could seriously harm business .

While implemented safety procedure related handling cell assurance safety issue fire related cell would disrupt operation . Such damage injury would likely lead adverse publicity potentially safety recall . Moreover failure competitor electric vehicle may cause indirect adverse publicity u electric vehicle . Such adverse publicity would negatively affect brand harm business prospect financial condition operating result . We exposed fluctuation currency exchange rate could negatively affect financial result Our revenue cost denominated foreign currency completely matched . As increased Model S delivery market outside United States much higher revenue cost denominated currency euro Norwegian krone Chinese yuan Canadian dollar . The recent strengthening U.S. dollar therefore reduced strengthening U.S. dollar would tend reduce revenue measured U.S. dollar . In addition portion cost expense anticipate continue denominated foreign currency including Japanese yen . If fully offsetting revenue currency value U.S. dollar depreciates significantly currency cost measured U.S. dollar percent revenue correspondingly increase margin suffer . As result operating result could adversely affected . 16 Our resale value guarantee leasing program expose u risk resale value vehicle returned u lower estimate may result lower revenue gross margin profitability liquidity . We offer resale value guarantee many customer customer may sell vehicle back u certain point time predetermined resale value . Customers lease vehicle leasing partner u directly captive finance company . The resale value vehicle resold returned u pursuant program may lower estimate based limited secondary market vehicle . If volume vehicle returned u higher estimate andor able resell timely liquidity could negatively impacted . In case customer retain vehicle past guarantee period gross margin negatively impacted remaining revenue cost related vehicle recognized gross profit . We apply lease accounting sale vehicle resale value guarantee lease made directly u . Under lease accounting recognize associated revenue cost vehicle sale time rather fully upfront vehicle delivery . As result program generate lower revenue period car delivered higher gross margin period resale value guarantee compared purchase resale value guarantee apply . A higher anticipated uptake program could therefore adverse impact near term revenue operating result . Moreover unlike resale value guarantee program program leasing partner impact cash flow liquidity time vehicle delivery lease held directly u may receive small portion total vehicle purchase price time lease followed stream payment term lease . To extent expand leasing program without securing external financing business partner support expansion cash flow liquidity could also negatively impacted . If fail effectively manage residual financing credit risk related direct Tesla leasing program business may suffer . We offer financing arrangement local subsidiary United States Canada Germany UK including leasing directly certain subsidiary . The profitability leasing program depends ability accurately project residual value secure adequate financing andor business partner fund grow program manage customer credit risk . If actual residual value vehicle estimate may suffer lower profitability potentially loss . If unable adequately fund leasing program either internal fund external financing source may unable grow sale . Additionally properly screen customer creditworthiness may exposed excessive credit risk associated loss . Furthermore leasing business grows substantially business may suffer effectively manage greater level residual credit risk resulting growth . Finally successfully monitor comply applicable national state andor local financial regulation consumer protection law governing lease transaction may become subject enforcement action penalty either may harm business . Increases cost disruption supply shortage raw material particular lithiumion cell could harm business . We may experience increase cost sustained interruption supply shortage raw material . Any increase supply interruption could materially negatively impact business prospect financial condition operating result . We use various raw material business including aluminum steel nickel copper . The price raw material fluctuate depending market condition global demand material could adversely affect business operating result . For instance exposed multiple risk relating lithiumion cell .
